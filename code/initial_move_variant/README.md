## Description

This folder contains simulation files and figure results for a robustness check that was asked during peer-review: having the ``daughter'' particle move by one cell diameter (depending on its identity, micro- or nano-phytoplankton) from the mother particle. As shown in `figure`, the equivalent Fig. 3 is near identical to that produced by the classical Brownian Bug Model.
