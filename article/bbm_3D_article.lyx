\begin_layout Abstract
The coexistence of multiple phytoplankton species despite their reliance
 on similar resources is often explained with mean-field models assuming
 mixed populations.
 In reality, observations of phytoplankton indicate spatial aggregation
 at all scales, including at the scale of individuals, possibly hindering
 competitive exclusion since monospecific patches reduce competition with
 other species.
 To evaluate how such local spatial aggregation could explain phytoplankton
 diversity maintenance, an individual-based, multispecific representation
 of cells in a realistic hydrodynamic environment is required.
 Here, we generalize a mathematically tractable individual-based model of
 phytoplankton population dynamics in a viscous and turbulent environment
 to multiple species and three dimensions.
 The model is studied through both simulations and the derivation of spatial
 moment equations, in connection with point process theory.
 The spatial moment equations show a good match between theory and simulations.
 Parameters are based on phytoplankters’ ecological and physical characteristics
, for both large and small phytoplankton.
 We find that when turbulence is considered, species are more mixed than
 in an environment dominated solely by viscosity.
 Defining a zone of potential interaction as the overlap between nutrient
 depletion volumes, we show that local species composition - within the
 range of possible interactions - depends on the type of phytoplankton considere
d.
 In large phytoplankton, individuals are surrounded by cells from other
 species, while in small phytoplankton, individuals remain in mostly monospecifi
c clusters.
 Intraspecific interactions are therefore more likely than interspecific
 interactions for small phytoplankton, which is a possible explanation for
 diversity maintenance, while other mechanisms of coexistence must be examined
 for large phytoplankton.

Introduction

\begin_layout Standard
Phytoplankton communities are among the most important photosynthetic groups
 on Earth, being at the bottom of the marine food chain, and responsible
 for half the global primary production

.
 Their contribution to ecosystem functions is only matched by their contribution
 to biodiversity.
 Indeed, phytoplankton communities are characterized by a surprisingly high
 biodiversity, up to dozens of species within multiple genera and even classes
 in volumes as small as 10 mL.
 This observation has led to the formulation of the so-called

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, which refers to the conflict between the observed diversity of species
 competing for similar resources in a seemingly homogeneous environment,
 and theoretical expectations of a few species outcompeting the others.
 Phytoplankton models for coexistence are now almost as diverse as their
 model organisms

 and benefit from the support of coexistence theory which proposes mechanisms
 to escape from competitive exclusion, including non-linear responses to
 a temporally fluctuating environment

 However, most of these models consider mean-field dynamics in a non-spatial
 setting, i.e., keep the premise of a homogeneous habitat.
 Such assumption needs to be challenged, as field observations themselves
 have revealed phytoplankton patchiness for more than a century

\begin_layout Standard
Phytoplankton patchiness can at least be partly explained by the hydrodynamics
 of their environment: their size being mostly below the size of the smallest
 eddy (i.e., the Kolmogorov scale) in a typical environment such as the ocean,
 they are embedded in viscous micro-structures at the individual level

 while being displaced by a common flow at the larger scale, due to turbulence

\end_inset

.
 Viscosity decreases diffusivity, which can in turn generate a heterogeneous
 landscape by limiting movements and mixing.
 At the other end of the hydrodynamics spectrum, studies on the fluid mechanics
 of phytoplankton show that a turbulent flow, sometimes associated with
 other phenomena such as motility can encourage the formation of clusters

This leads us to consider demography in the context of environmental variation

 Individual-based models provide a convenient depiction of population dynamics
 and movement at the microscale

 In this framework, population growth is a result of individual births and
 deaths.
 Aggregation of particles can emerge from local reproduction coupled with
 limited dispersal, which can happen in a fluid where turbulence and diffusion
 are not too high too disperse kin aggregates 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 Such aggregation can affect the dynamics of the populations at the community
 level: even when interactions are identical between individuals of the
 same species (conspecifics) or between individuals of different species
 (heterospecifics), the combination of local reproduction and same-scale
 high dispersal limitation and strong interactions leads to stronger intraspecif
ic interactions than interspecific interactions at the population level,
 a major stabilizing mechanism

 Basically, a high intra-to-interspecific interaction strength ratio makes
 a species control its abundance more than it controls the abundance of
 other species, which is associated with coexistence in models

 Therefore, the microscale spatial distribution of individuals likely affect
 the interaction structure within a community, and may sustain diversity.

 This is quite useful to understand how species with marked differences
 coexist.
 However, the difficulty of the coexistence problems is precisely that we
 have to explain how species such as e.g.
 diatoms, many of whom have similar size, buoyancy, chemical composition,
 etc., manage to coexist within a single trophic level.
 This requires to model

 species in spatially realistic environment and measure whether they aggregate
 or segregate in space.

In order to understand the maintenance of highly diverse communities, we
 need to consider models with more species than two opposite archetypes.
 To our knowledge, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 have modeled the only individual-based model including turbulence, but
 not diffusion, for up to 5 species, in which they show that physical characteri
stics of the cell (the inertia related to the size of the organism) allow
 for aggregation and coexistence.
 While taking diversity of organisms into account is the first step towards
 studying coexistence in spatial models, the paucity of studies with multiple
 species can be explained by the computational cost of modeling many, possibly
 interacting, individuals, especially because very large numbers are required
 for phytoplankton organisms which can reach concentrations up to 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{6}$
\end_inset

 C/L.
 Numerical costs could however be partially offset by favoring mathematical
 analyses.
 Indeed, the random distributions of events emerging from a series of stochastic
 processes that constitute the type of model we describe here are known
 as spatial point processes, and can be studied by spatial statistics, via
 the evaluation of aggregated quantities such as correlations between pairs
 of points.

, an individual-based model which includes fluid turbulence and passive

 The initial version of this model

 coupled limited dispersal and local reproduction with ocean-like hydrodynamics
 and showed spatial clusters of individuals of the same species.
 It was limited to a single species and a two-dimensional environment.
 Furthermore, the model was not strongly quantitative

 in the sense that parameters were not informed by current knowledge on
 phytoplankton biology (numbers of cells per liter, diffusion characteristics,
 etc.).
 As phytoplankton organisms live in a three-dimensional environment, informing
 the model with realistic parameters required us to shift to three dimensions.
 We also added the possibility for multiple species, and consider two types
 of communities, which are either made of nanophytoplankton (3

 It is possible to derive the dynamics of the pair density function, which
 quantifies the degree of intra- and interspecific clustering of organisms,
 via correlations between positions of organisms (see Methods).
 This means that in addition to simulations, we can keep track analytically
 of spatial structure.
 Furthermore, because we do not consider direct interactions between particles,
 the multispecies spatial point process is mathematically a random superposition
 of point processes, one for each species 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 This enables us to derive, in addition to the pair correlation function,
 analytical formulas for the species composition of the neighbourhood of
 an individual, which are more readily ecologically interpreted than the
 pair density or correlation function.

 It is a realization of the spatial point process deriving from a stochastic,
 spatialized individual-based model such as the Brownian Bug Model.
 One of the most common methods to describe a spatial point process is through
 its moments, that can be theoretically derived and allow us to check our
 simulations.
 However, the spatial moments of a process are merely mathematical quantities
 which then need to be related to ecological processes.
 This is the role of the dominance index, which we detail afterwards.

Range of interaction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we examine particle aggregation or segregation and their potential effects
 on interactions between species, we have to ascertain the volume around
 which a particle can be affected by the presence of other particles, or
 affect other particles.
 We only consider here interactions due to competition for nutrients, and
 therefore need to define a nutrient depletion volume.
 We approximate this volume as the sphere of radius 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $C(r)\leq90\%C_{\infty}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{\infty}$
\end_inset

 the background concentration of the nutrient (hereafter, the concentration
 boundary layer).
 The radius is maximized when the particle is in stagnant water (diffusion
 is the only hydrodynamics process).
 In this case, it corresponds to 10 times the radius of the particle 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 An overlap between depletion zones can therefore happen at distances as
 far as 10 times the diameter of a particle.
 We consider this maximum value as our baseline, keeping in mind that turbulence
 reduces the size of the concentration boundary layer and cause an increasing
 nutrient flux to the cell

Differences in distributions are not only due to particle sizes, but also
 to their abundances.
 When turbulence is taken into account, the dominance index decreases at
 lower radii around a particle when abundance is higher (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "fig:Carac_10sp"

 a-b): species which are more abundant tend to be omnipresent when they
 are mixed in the environment, which also makes them more likely to be close
 to a heterospecific, but they still also have more conspecifics close to
 them than the less abundant species.
 When turbulence is absent, the effect of abundance on the dominance index
 decrease is reversed: a 5% decrease is reached for a higher radius when
 species are more abundant for microphytoplankton, which may indicate that
 particle growth offsets diffusion in this case.
 The relationship is more complex for nanophytoplankton: the minimum radius
 for a 5% decrease in dominance index is reached for intermediate abundances;
 there is possibly a trade-off between occupation of the space due to mixing
 by diffusion and growth of particles around their conspecifics.
 The effect of average abundances on the composition of a particle neighbourhood
 within its depletion zone is less significant for nanophytoplankton than
 for microphytoplankton (Fig.

We designed a stochastic, 3D, individual-based model of multiple species
 of particles in a viscous and turbulent flow, and conducted both analytical
 and numerical analyses to quantify spatial correlations in particle distributio
ns.
 We focused on the pair correlation functions and Ripley's K-functions,
 for which numerical and theoretical analyses showed a good agreement, and
 computed the corresponding dominance index to quantify the degree of intraspeci
fic clustering and interspecific mixing.
 Comparing the distributions of organisms of different sizes and demography,
 we showed that the composition of the environment of a particle depends
 on its traits.
 While turbulence always leads to more mixing, microphytoplankters, larger
 cells with a lower diffusivity, encountered heterospecifics at larger distances
 from the particle than nanophytoplankton, but the zone in which competition
 for nutrient was more likely also had a more diverse composition than for
 smaller cells.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Intraspecific clustering at small distances from a particle was a constant
 in our model.
 It shows a balance between diffusivity and turbulence, possibly speeding
 up the separation of particles, and growth rates, which increases their
 aggregation.
 The distance between particles is relevant, as each phytoplanktonic cell
 creates a zone of depletion around itself, where nutrient concentration
 is lower than the ambient concentration 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "karp-boss_nutrient_1996"
literal "false"

\end_inset

: when particles are close enough to decrease concentration of nutrients
 in their respective zones of depletion, competition for nutrients, often
 assumed to be the main direct interaction between primary producers, may
 happen.
 Provided all species are equivalent with regards to their nutrient requirement
 and consumption, the possible interaction structure emerges from the spatial
 structure, itself being a result of the balance between mixing and clustering.
 The results of such balance are size-dependent: nanophytoplankton organisms
 mainly share this space with conspecifics while microphytoplankton organisms
 can affect both conspecifics and heterospecifics.
 It should be noted that interaction via zone of depletion overlap has been
 debated, but usely in the context of a uniform distribution 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 and/or with diffusion only 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "hulburt_competition_1970"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 whereas we show that minimum distances between conspecifics are much lower
 than expected from a uniform distribution (Section SX in SI).
 While competition for nutrient is the most direct interaction between particles
, indirect interactions can also affect phytoplankton growth.
 For instance, each particle is surrounded by a a micro-environment called
 the phycosphere, where communities of bacteria exchange with the particle
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 This tends to confirm that microphytoplankton organisms are much more likely
 to interact with heterospecifics than nanophytoplankton individuals, via
 exchanges of compounds necessary for their survival.
 Additional phenomena may however counterbalance the presence of heterospecifics
 near larger cells: these are much more sensitive to increases in turbulence,
 which reduce the volumes of specific zones around them and augment nutrient
 uptakes

 Here, both the phycosphere and the depletion zone sizes are maximized,

 If we adjusted depletion zone sizes with turbulence in mind, conspecifics

 While a high intra-to-interspecific interaction strength ratio is mostly
 associated to niche differences, we propose here that, even with equivalent
 species, other mechanisms are at stake: diversity may partly depend on
 the balance between diffusion and growth rates for nanophytoplankton, while
 turbulence might be a key mechanism for microphytoplankton.

Our model focuses on size as the defining trait of the communities we consider,
 with microphytoplankton being larger than nanophytoplankton by an order
 of magnitude.
 Indeed, size is considered as a major functional trait

 In this model, we focus on a single size per phytoplankton category, which
 defines both the diffusivity and the growth rate of the organisms.
 Smaller sizes lead to a higher diffusivity, i.e.
 less clustering, and a higher growth rate, i.e.
 more clustering, but they also have a smaller zone of depletion.
 In reality, phytoplankton size classes cover a much wider range

 Taking into account this variability creates new mechanisms sustaining

 These results complement ours in the sense that they highlight the relevance
 of turbulence at microscale to produce new spatial niches for particles
 of different sizes.
 We can assume that, in our model, introducing a size gradient for species
 within a single phytoplankton community would create more complex spatial
 distributions.
 However, patterns of the dominance index were consistent between organisms:
 more than one order of magnitude between nanophytoplankton and microphytoplankt
on sizes did not change the emergence of clustering at small scales, relevant
 for interactions.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Here, interactions are only defined indirectly as we consider distances
 from a particle in which competition for nutrients may happen.
 However, particles interactions can be modeled a much more direct way.
 For instance, birth and death rates can be density-dependent:

 show that when density-dependence and attraction between motile particles
 are defined within a specific range of distances around a particle (defining
 a kernel of interactions), clusters of organisms emerge.
 Even in the absence of demographic processes, attraction between particles
 able to control their location, whether by active movement or by buoyancy/orien
tation regulation, is sufficient to create dense clusters - especially when
 length scales associated to interactions and turbulence are close 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Coloniality is common for phytoplankton, and its absence in our model leading
 to larger cells being close to heterospecifics may also indicate that it
 may have emerged as a way to offst hydrodynamics mixing.

We designed a stochastic, three-dimension, individual-based model of the
 spatial distribution of multiple species in a viscous and turbulent flow.
 We conducted both mathematical analyses and numerical simulations to quantify
 spatial correlations in particle distributions.
 We focused on the pair correlation function and Ripley's K-function, for
 which numerical and theoretical analyses showed a good agreement, and extracted
 a more ecologically-oriented statistics from them,

 the dominance index.
 This statistic is the 
\shape italic
local
\shape default
 average ratio of the number of organisms of a given species in the neighbourhoo
d of a particle of the same species, compared to the total number of organisms,
 as a function of the distance from the particle.
 Intraspecific clustering corresponds to a dominance index close to 1, which
 decreases when interspecific mixing increases.
 The choice of this index was motivated by two reasons: it is at its core
 a proportion of a focus species in a certain volume, i.e.
 a scale-dependent, localized metric bounded between 0 and 1 as opposed
 to other statistics whose values are less directly interpreted, and is
 easy to relate to coexistence theory as it describes the environment of
 a particle in terms of heterospecifics and conspecifics, which can, under
 certain hypotheses we discuss below, be related to interspecific and intraspeci
fic interactions.
 Comparing the distributions of organisms of different sizes and demography,
 we showed that the presence and intensity (Section SX) of turbulence always
 increased mixing, and that the species composition around a particle depended
 on its size, which mechanically determines its hydrodynamics properties
 (diffusivity), and is linked with its ecological characteristics (growth
 rate and density).
 Microphytoplankters (20 to 200

\end_inset

 m), but they were surrounded by more heterospecifics than conspecifics
 within a volume of potential interactions, defined as the maximum distance
 for which nutrient depletion volumes may overlap.
 Microphytoplankters were therefore more likely to interact with individuals
 from other species than with individuals of their own species.
 However, if we consider different distances within the volume of potential
 interactions, this affirmation needs to be nuanced: there was always a
 (potentially small) radius around a particle for which the community remained
 monospecific.
 Variability in species composition of the neighbourhood only intervened
 for larger distances.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We first focus on the smallest distances between particles.
 The nearest neighbour of a particle was always a particle of the same species,
 and the minimum distance between conspecifics was always lower than expected
 for a uniform distribution (Section SX).
 The dominance index remained close to 1 for distances below 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{-2}$

\begin_inset Formula $10^{-3}$
\end_inset

 cm for microphytoplankton and nanophytoplankton respectively.
 There was therefore always 
\emph on
some
\emph default
 intraspecific aggregation, i.e.
 some conspecifics were always closer than heterospecifics.
 This is due to the prevalence of demographic processes at individual scales,
 because a particle acts as a source point for other organisms of the same
 species, and hydrodynamics processes do not separate conspecifics fast
 enough to prevent aggregation.
 If we consider that interaction strengths are a smooth decaying function
 of distance, a common assumption in spatial coexistence models 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
before "e.g., "
key "bolker_spatial_1999,law_population_2003"

\end_inset

, this means that population-level intraspecific interactions could be stronger
 than interspecific interactions due to intraspecific micro-scale aggregation.
 However, the mechanisms of competition at this scale are poorly known,
 likely relying on multiple types of resources with different distributions
 in the environment, effects on the cell, uptakes, etc.
 Rather than considering only interactions with the closest neighbour(s),
 we therefore chose to define a maximum distance for two particles to possibly
 affect the concentrations of elements in the environment of each other.

[F: There is interesting information in there but it is unclear what we
 the reader should make of it.] Changes in average density also impact the
 distance between conspecifics: a higher density automatically reduces the
 expected distances between particles, and therefore the distance to the
 nearest neighbour (Section SX).
 Distances between individuals can have a direct effect on their interactions:
 as a phytoplankter creates a gradient of depletion around itself, where
 nutrient concentrations are lower as we get closer to the cell 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, competition for nutrient is likely stronger between closer individuals,
 i.e.
 between conspecifics.
 Furthermore, nutrients are not the only elements that can be exchanged
 between particles: for example, sharing the phycosphere, a micro-environment
 where communities of bacteria interact This spatial aggregation created
 by the balance between diffusion and fission rate is also modulated by
 the abundance of a species within the volume of observation.
 Indeed, as we model communities at a steady-state population size (on average),
 population densities are parameters in our model.

, can also impact organisms, both positively and negatively.
 If all species are equivalent with regards to their nutrient requirements
 and consumption, only the distances between individuals, not the identity
 of the individuals, changes the strength (or even existence) of their interacti
on.
 In this case, the interaction structure of the community will emerge from
 the spatial structure of individuals at distances relevant for interactions,
 i.e.
 at the microscale, and intraspecific aggregates make intraspecific interactions
 more likely to be stronger than interspecific interactions at the population
 level, which is itself a crucial parameter in coexistence theory

 While a high intra-to-interspecific interaction strength ratio is often
 associated with niche differences related to finite resources (nutrient,
 light, vitamins, etc.) in models of community, we propose here that it can
 also emerge from the spatial distribution of individuals, which is affected
 by the trade-off between demographics and hydrodynamics processes.

Dominances began to decrease at distances above 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{-3}$
\end_inset

 cm, still below the maximum distance for interactions.
 At this distance and above, the balance between heterospecifics and conspecific
s was much more sensitive to different phytoplankton's demographics and
 hydrodynamics traits.
 The species composition of a particle's neighbourhood depended on its size:
 nanophytoplankton organisms mainly shared their volume of interactions
 with conspecifics (the dominance index remained close to 1, even near the
 overlap threshold) while microphytoplankton organisms could affect both
 conspecifics and heterospecifics (the dominance index was often below 50%
 at the overlap threshold, i.e.
 a particle's depletion zone probably overlapped with more heterospecifics'
 than conspecifics').
 Microphytoplankters were therefore more likely to interact with heterospecifics
 than nanophytoplankters, due to their lower reproduction rate.
 The rate of production of new conspecifics was not sufficient compensate
 for the separation velocity due to turbulence and diffusivity, even though
 the diffusion range of microphytoplankter's was smaller than the nanophytoplank
ter's.
 There may therefore be different mechanisms at play at the community level
 for microphytoplankton and nanophytoplankton.
 For nanophytoplankton, the interactions network of the community is likely
 characterized by intraspecific interactions stronger than interspecific
 interactions, which is key in coexistence theory 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "barabas_self-regulation_2017"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 For microphytoplankton, while we have shown that interactions at the individual
 level may be stronger with a conspecific, interactions are more frequent
 with heterospecifics.
 There is therefore a balance between strength and frequency of interactions
 which precludes direct conclusions regarding the relative strengths of
 interactions at the community level.
 The dominance of heterospecifics in a microphytoplankter's neighbourhood
 may however be debated.
 Indeed, when computing the volumes of zones relevant for interactions based
 on nutrient concentrations around a cell, we used maximum volumes, correspondin
g to a diffusive-only flow.
 When turbulence increases, uptake increases and the size of the depletion
 zone decreases 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "karp-boss_nutrient_1996"

\end_inset

 The proportion of change in the depletion volume increases with the size
 of organism, meaning that larger cells such as microphytoplankters are
 much more sensitive to turbulence increases than smaller cells

key "karp-boss_nutrient_1996,barton_impact_2014"

 If we adjusted depletion-volume sizes with turbulence in mind, conspecifics
 might be as predominant around a microphytoplankton particle as they are
 for nanophytoplankton 
\shape italic

 relevant zones.
 While microphytoplankton individuals may interact more with heterospecifics
 than nanophytoplankton individuals, we should therefore be cautious in
 saying that microphytoplankton individuals interact with more heterospecifics
 than conspecifics.

\begin_layout Standard
Up to now, we have only focused on the dominance index, a localized ratio
 of average densities multiplied by the local average number of neighbours
 of a particle, therefore focusing on relative densities, but interactions
 also depend on the absolute numbers of individuals.
 Mechanically, when density decreases, the distances between neighbours
 increases, which explains that the distances between the low-abundance
 microphytoplankters tended to be greater than distances between high-abundance
 nanophytoplankters.
 The separation can even reach the maximum threshold for interactions to
 happen: there might therefore be a point for which a particle is only surrounde
d by its own children, which are then advected further.
 Interactions may therefore be scarce in both space and time.
 At the other end of the spectrum, high densities could have a paradoxical
 effect: a species with a higher density was omnipresent, and heterospecifics
 were closer when compared to a lower-density species, even though this
 species was more dominant in its interaction range.
 These observations are however dependent on the densities we considered
 in our model, which correspond to annual average.
 If we were to model populations in a bloom, during which microphytoplankton
 particles can reach

 community

, we would likely see the dominance of the single blooming species at all
 scales.
 The environment is also modified by a bloom: the competition can increase
 due to depletion of nutrients in the whole environment.
 If we want to make more general conclusions on interactions structure in
 different conditions (

 interactions.

 Contrary to other models

, we did not consider explicit effects of density dependence between individuals
, as we cannot be sure that this kind of interaction, more often observed
 at the population level and macroscale, applies similarly between individuals,
 especially for the time scales we consider.
 Another, possibly more relevant, way of modeling interactions would be
 to introduce resource points in the cube, which could in turn change the
 reproduction or death rate of individuals.
 Such mechanism is mostly adequate for interactions due to competition for
 nutrients, but other mechanisms can be considered.
 For example, sharing the phycosphere, a micro-environment where communities
 of bacteria interact with the particle

 In this case, the phycosphere position directly depends on the position
 of the organism, and the volume of interactions also varies with size:
 nanophytoplankton phycosphere's sizes are neglible while microphytoplankters
 can have very large phycosphere (1200

 or natural enemies.

Other interactions between microphytoplankton do not directly affect their
 survival, but their position: most phytoplankters are able to move willingly,
