\begin_layout Abstract
The coexistence of multiple phytoplankton species despite their reliance
 on similar resources is often explained with mean-field models assuming
 mixed populations.
 In reality, observations of phytoplankton indicate spatial aggregation
 at all scales, including at the scale of a few individuals.
 Local spatial aggregation can hinder competitive exclusion since individuals
 then interact mostly with other individuals of their own species, rather
 than competitors from different species.
 To evaluate how microscale spatial aggregation could explain phytoplankton
 diversity maintenance, an individual-based, multispecific representation
 of cells in a realistic hydrodynamic environment is required.
 We therefore used as a starting point a mathematically tractable individual-bas
ed model of phytoplankton population dynamics in a viscous and turbulent
 environment, and generalize it here to multiple species and three dimensions.
 The model is studied through both simulations and the derivation of spatial
 moment equations, in connection with point process theory.
 The spatial moment equations show a good match between theory and simulations.
 We parameterized the model based on phytoplankters’ ecological and physical
 characteristics, for both large and small phytoplankton.
 Defining a zone of potential interaction as the overlap between nutrient
 depletion volumes, we show that local species composition—within the range
 of possible interactions—depends on the size class of phytoplankton.
 In large phytoplankton, individuals are surrounded by cells from other
 species, while in small phytoplankton, individuals remain in mostly monospecifi
c clusters.
 Spatial structure therefore favours intra- over inter-specific interactions
 for small phytoplankton, which likely contributes to coexistence mechanisms,
 while other factors behind diversity maintenance must be examined for large
 phytoplankton.

Phytoplankton communities are among the most important photosynthetic groups
 on Earth, being at the bottom of the marine food chain, and responsible

 Their contribution to ecosystem functions is only matched by their contribution
 to biodiversity.
 Indeed, phytoplankton communities are characterized by a surprisingly high
 biodiversity.
 For example, a single sample as small as a few mL can contain up to seventy
 species

 However, most of these models consider mean-field dynamics at the microscale.
 Such assumption needs to be challenged, as field observations themselves
 have revealed phytoplankton patchiness for more than a century

 Viscosity decreases diffusivity, which can in turn generate a heterogeneous
 landscape by limiting movements and mixing.
 At the other end of the hydrodynamics spectrum, studies on the fluid mechanics
 of phytoplankton show that a turbulent flow, sometimes associated with
 other phenomena such as motility can encourage the formation of clusters

 In this framework, population growth is a result of individual births and
 deaths.
 Aggregation of particles can emerge from local reproduction coupled with
 limited dispersal, which can happen in a fluid where turbulence and diffusion
 are not too high to disperse kin aggregates 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "young_reproductive_2001"

\end_inset

 Such aggregation can affect the dynamics of the populations at the community
 level: even when interactions are identical between individuals of the
 same species (conspecifics) or between individuals of different species
 (heterospecifics), the combination of local reproduction and same-scale
 high dispersal limitation and strong interactions leads to stronger intraspecif
ic interactions than interspecific interactions at the population level,
 a major stabilizing mechanism

 Basically, a high intra-to-interspecific interaction strength ratio makes
 a species control its abundance more than it controls the abundance of
 other species, which is associated with coexistence in theoretical models

 This is quite useful to understand how species with marked differences
 coexist.
 However, the difficulty of the coexistence problem is precisely that we
 have to explain how closely related species or genera (e.g., within diatoms),
 many of whom have similar size, buoyancy, chemical composition, etc., manage
 to coexist within a single trophic level.
 This requires to model 
\emph on
similar

 species in spatially realistic environment and measure whether they aggregate
 or segregate in space.

In order to understand the maintenance of highly diverse communities, we
 need to consider models with more species than two opposite archetypes.
 To our knowledge,

 have modeled the only individual-based model including turbulence, but
 not diffusion, for up to 5 species, in which they show that physical characteri
stics of the cell (the inertia related to the size of the organism) allow
 for aggregation and coexistence.
 While taking diversity of organisms into account is the first step towards
 studying coexistence in spatial models, the paucity of studies with multiple
 species can be explained by the computational cost of modeling many, possibly
 interacting, individuals, especially because very large numbers are required
 for phytoplankton organisms which can reach concentrations up to 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{6}$
\end_inset

 C/L.
 Numerical costs could however be partially offset by favoring mathematical
 analyses.
 Indeed, the random distributions of events emerging from a series of stochastic
 processes that constitute the type of model we describe here are known
 as spatial point processes, and can be studied by spatial statistics, via
 the evaluation of aggregated quantities such as correlations between pairs
 of points.

, an individual-based model which includes a chaotic advection process mimicking
 a turbulent fluid flow, passive diffusion of organisms, as well as stochastic
 birth and death processes.
 The initial version of this model

 coupled limited dispersal and local reproduction with ocean-like microscale
 hydrodynamics, and showed spatial clusters of individuals of the same species.
 It was limited to a single species and a two-dimensional environment.
 Furthermore, the model was not strongly quantitative

 in the sense that parameters were not informed by current knowledge on
 phytoplankton biology (numbers of cells per liter, diffusion characteristics,
 etc.).
 As phytoplankton organisms live in a three-dimensional environment, informing
 the model with realistic parameters required us to shift to three dimensions.
 We also extend the model to multiple species, and consider two size classes
 for our phytoplankton communities, which are either made of nanophytoplankton

 It is further complexified by the presence of a turbulent fluid flow in

 as well as here.
 In spite of this complexity, it remains possible to derive the dynamics
 of pair density functions, which quantify the degree of intra- and interspecifi
c clustering of organisms, via correlations between positions of organisms
 (see Methods).
 This means that in addition to simulations, we can keep track analytically
 of spatial structure.
 Furthermore, because we do not consider direct interactions between organisms,
 the multispecies spatial point process that represents the stable state
 of the Brownian Bug model is mathematically a random superposition of spatial
 point processes for each species 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 This enables us to derive, in addition to pair correlation functions, analytica
l formulas for the species composition of the neighbourhood of an individual,
 which are more readily ecologically interpreted than pair density or correlatio
n functions.

\begin_layout Standard
One of the most common methods to describe a spatial point process is through
 its spatial moments, that can be theoretically derived and allow us to
 check our simulations.
 However, the spatial moments of a process are merely statistical indicators
 which then need to be related to more easily ecologically interpretable
 quantities.
 This is the role of the dominance index, which we present below.

\end_inset

 is the number of particles of species 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 in the cube 
\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $V(W)=L^{3}$
\end_inset

 is the volume of the cube; it does not give any information regarding the
 spatial distribution of particles, and possibly their spatial correlations.

Range of interaction

\begin_layout Standard
As we examine particle aggregation or segregation and their potential effects
 on interactions between species, we have to ascertain the volume around
 which a particle can be affected by the presence of other particles, or
 affect other particles.
 We only consider here interactions due to competition for nutrients, and
 therefore need to define a nutrient depletion volume.
 We approximate this volume as the sphere of radius 
\begin_inset Formula $r$

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $C(r)\leq90\%C_{\infty}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{\infty}$
\end_inset

 the background concentration of the nutrient.
 The radius of this nutrient depletion volume is maximized when the particle
 is in stagnant water (diffusion is the only hydrodynamics process).
 In this case, it corresponds to 10 times the radius of the particle

As we examine particle clustering or segregation and their potential effects
 on interactions between species, we consider two main processes: direct
 interactions due to, e.g., competition for nutrients, auxotrophy or allotrophy,
 and emerging interactions due to predation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Direct interactions due to a given chemical (whether a resource or a toxin)
 can only take place if the chemical concentration is relevant for the particle.
 We therefore need to define the volume around each particle in which microscale
 interactions can take place before the dilution effect of diffusion and
 turbulence take over.
 This volume will be called the phycosphere hereafter

: clustering is not visible to the naked eye, even when zooming in the observati

 Microphytoplankton distributions are not so easy to analyse as no clusters
 can be detected from basic observations, whether advection is included
 or not (Section S5 of the SI).
 Statistics are therefore needed to go further in detecting patterns of
 aggregation.

 The dominance index is close to 1 for small distances: there is always
 a scale at which an organism is surrounded almost only by conspecifics.
 The index then decreases sharply

 to converge at large distances (close to 1 cm) to the proportion of the
 focus species in the whole community, as it would for a uniform distribution.
 Patterns differ at intermediate ranges of distances between organisms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the presence of advection, the dominance index starts decreasing for
 a distance between 5 and 10 times lower than when advection is absent,
 which indicates that organisms are closer to heterospecifics when their
 environment is turbulent.
 A quasi-uniform distribution is also reached for smaller distances with
 advection than without.
 Microphytoplankton species start mixing for distances larger than for nanophyto
plankton species irrespective of the hydrodynamic regime surrounding them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a 3-species community with the same initial abundances, microphytoplankton
 dominance indices are between 0.37 and 0.47 at the distance threshold for
 potential interactions, while it is between 0.80 and 0.94 for nanophytoplankton
 species when advection is present.
 In the absence of turbulence, dominance indices are all above 0.98 when
 the distance threshold is reached (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

 Microphytoplankton organisms are therefore as likely to share their depletion
 volume with conspecifics as they are with heterospecifics, but only when
 turbulent advection is accounted for, whereas nanophytoplankton organisms
 have almost only conspecifics around them.

 falls below 95% is smaller for more abundant species (Fig.

 Abundant species tend to be present nearly everywhere when they are mixed
 in the environment.
 Therefore, they are also more likely to be close to a heterospecific, but
 still have more conspecifics close to them than the less abundant species

We designed a stochastic, 3D, individual-based model of multiple species
 of particles in a viscous and turbulent flow, and conducted both analytical
 and numerical analyses to quantify spatial correlations in particle distributio
ns.
 We focused on the pair correlation functions and Ripley's K-functions,
 for which numerical and theoretical analyses showed a good agreement, and
 computed the corresponding dominance index to quantify the degree of intraspeci
fic clustering and interspecific mixing.
 Comparing the distributions of organisms of different sizes and demography,
 we showed that the composition of the environment of a particle depends
 on its traits.
 While turbulence always leads to more mixing, microphytoplankters, larger
 cells with a lower diffusivity, encountered heterospecifics at larger distances
 from the particle than nanophytoplankton, but the zone in which competition
 for nutrient was more likely also had a more diverse composition than for
 smaller cells.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Intraspecific clustering at small distances from a particle was a constant
 in our model.
 It shows a balance between diffusivity and turbulence, possibly speeding
 up the separation of particles, and growth rates, which increases their
 aggregation.
 The distance between particles is relevant, as each phytoplanktonic cell
 creates a zone of depletion around itself, where nutrient concentration
 is lower than the ambient concentration 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "karp-boss_nutrient_1996"
literal "false"

\end_inset

: when particles are close enough to decrease concentration of nutrients
 in their respective zones of depletion, competition for nutrients, often
 assumed to be the main direct interaction between primary producers, may
 happen.
 Provided all species are equivalent with regards to their nutrient requirement
 and consumption, the possible interaction structure emerges from the spatial
 structure, itself being a result of the balance between mixing and clustering.
 The results of such balance are size-dependent: nanophytoplankton organisms
 mainly share this space with conspecifics while microphytoplankton organisms
 can affect both conspecifics and heterospecifics.
 It should be noted that interaction via zone of depletion overlap has been
 debated, but usely in the context of a uniform distribution

 and/or with diffusion only 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 whereas we show that minimum distances between conspecifics are much lower
 than expected from a uniform distribution (Section SX in SI).
 While competition for nutrient is the most direct interaction between particles
, indirect interactions can also affect phytoplankton growth.
 For instance, each particle is surrounded by a a micro-environment called
 the phycosphere, where communities of bacteria exchange with the particle

 This tends to confirm that microphytoplankton organisms are much more likely
 to interact with heterospecifics than nanophytoplankton individuals, via
 exchanges of compounds necessary for their survival.
 Additional phenomena may however counterbalance the presence of heterospecifics
 near larger cells: these are much more sensitive to increases in turbulence,
 which reduce the volumes of specific zones around them and augment nutrient
 uptakes

 Here, both the phycosphere and the depletion zone sizes are maximized,
 only accounting for diffusive processes.
 If we adjusted depletion zone sizes with turbulence in mind, conspecifics
 would be as predominant for microphytoplankton as they are for nanophytoplankto

 While a high intra-to-interspecific interaction strength ratio is mostly
 associated to niche differences, we propose here that, even with equivalent
 species, other mechanisms are at stake: diversity may partly depend on
 the balance between diffusion and growth rates for nanophytoplankton, while
 turbulence might be a key mechanism for microphytoplankton.
 
\begin_inset Note Note

While this might be a major mechanism explaining coexistence in nanophytoplankto

 by other phenomena which are not presented here, such as predation or parasitis

 or different functional traits (XXX).

Our model focuses on size as the defining trait of the communities we consider,
 with microphytoplankton being larger than nanophytoplankton by an order
 of magnitude.
 Indeed, size is considered as a major functional trait

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 In this model, we focus on a single size per phytoplankton category, which
 defines both the diffusivity and the growth rate of the organisms.
 Smaller sizes lead to a higher diffusivity, i.e.
 less clustering, and a higher growth rate, i.e.
 more clustering, but they also have a smaller zone of depletion.
 In reality, phytoplankton size classes cover a much wider range 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Taking into account this variability creates new mechanisms sustaining
 diversity: for example, size-based inertia in a chaotic flow creates size-speci
fic aggregates, implying more conspecifics clusters 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 These results complement ours in the sense that they highlight the relevance
 of turbulence at microscale to produce new spatial niches for particles
 of different sizes.
 We can assume that, in our model, introducing a size gradient for species
 within a single phytoplankton community would create more complex spatial
 distributions.
 However, patterns of the dominance index were consistent between organisms:
 more than one order of magnitude between nanophytoplankton and microphytoplankt
on sizes did not change the emergence of clustering at small scales, relevant
 for interactions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Here, interactions are only defined indirectly as we consider distances
 from a particle in which competition for nutrients may happen.
 However, particles interactions can be modeled a much more direct way.
 For instance, birth and death rates can be density-dependent:

\end_inset

 show that when density-dependence and attraction between motile particles
 are defined within a specific range of distances around a particle (defining
 a kernel of interactions), clusters of organisms emerge.
 Even in the absence of demographic processes, attraction between particles
 able to control their location, whether by active movement or by buoyancy/orien
tation regulation, is sufficient to create dense clusters - especially when
 length scales associated to interactions and turbulence are close 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, or when species are colonial and actively create clusters by sticking
 together

 Coloniality is common for phytoplankton, and its absence in our model leading
 to larger cells being close to heterospecifics may also indicate that it
 may have emerged as a way to offst hydrodynamics mixing.

We designed a stochastic, three-dimension, individual-based model of the
 spatial distribution of multiple species in a viscous and turbulent flow.
 We conducted both mathematical analyses and numerical simulations to quantify
 spatial correlations in organism distributions.
 We focused on the pair correlation function and Ripley's

 This statistic is the

\shape default
 average ratio of conspecifics, i.e., the number of organisms of the focal
 species in the neighbourhood of an individual of the same species, divided
 by the total number of organisms in that neighbourhood.
 Intraspecific clustering corresponds to a dominance index close to 1, which
 decreases when interspecific mixing increases.
 The choice of this index was motivated by two reasons: it is at its core
 a proportion of a focus species in a certain volume, i.e.
 a scale-dependent, localized metric bounded between 0 and 1 as opposed
 to other statistics whose values are less directly interpreted, and is
 easy to relate to coexistence theory as it describes the environment of
 an organism in terms of heterospecifics and conspecifics, which can, under
 certain hypotheses that we discuss below, be related to interspecific and
 intraspecific interactions.
 Comparing the distributions of organisms of different sizes and demography,
 we showed that the presence and intensity (Section S8 of the SI) of turbulence
 always increased mixing, and that the species composition around an organism
 depended on its size, which mechanically determines its hydrodynamics propertie
s (diffusivity), and is linked with its ecological characteristics (growth
 rate and density).
 Microphytoplankters (20 to 200

 on average further away from other cells, due to their lower concentrations

 However, they were surrounded by more heterospecifics than conspecifics
 within a volume of potential interactions, whose radius is defined as the
 maximum distance for which nutrient depletion volumes of two different
 individuals may overlap.
 If we consider that interactions between species (not modelled here), could
 occur with equal probability at all distances within the volume of potential
 interactions, we would conclude that microphytoplankters are more likely
 to interact with individuals from other species than with individuals of
 their own species.
 However,this affirmation is conditional upon interactions at 10 cell diameters
 from an individual being equally likely than at 1 diameter from an individual.
 If we keep in mind that interactions are more likely or stronger at very
 short distances, microphytoplankters may still experience more frequent
 effects of conspecifics than heterospecifics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To see this, let us first focus on the smallest distances between organisms.
 The nearest neighbour of an organism was always an organism of the same
 species, and the minimum distance between conspecifics was always lower
 than expected for a uniform distribution (Section S6 of the SI).
 The dominance index remained close to 1 for distances below 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{-2}$
\end_inset

 cm or 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{-3}$
\end_inset

 cm for microphytoplankton and nanophytoplankton respectively.
 There was therefore always 
\emph on
some
\emph default
 intraspecific aggregation, i.e.
 conspecifics were always closer than heterospecifics at the lowest distances.
 This is due to the prevalence of demographic processes at individual scales,
 because an individual acts as a source point for other organisms of the
 same species, and hydrodynamic processes do not separate conspecifics fast
 enough to prevent aggregation.
 If we consider that interaction strengths are a smoothly decaying function
 of distance, a common assumption in spatial coexistence models 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
before "e.g., "
key "bolker_spatial_1999,law_population_2003"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, this implies that population-level intraspecific interactions could be
 stronger than interspecific interactions due to intraspecific micro-scale
 aggregation.
 However, the mechanisms of competition at this scale are poorly known,
 likely relying on multiple types of resources with different distributions
 in the environment, effects on the cell, uptakes, etc.
 Rather than weighting much more heavily the potential interactions with
 the closest neighbour(s) through an interaction kernel, we therefore chose
 conservatively to define a maximum distance for two organisms to possibly
 affect the concentrations of elements in the environment of each other.

[F: There is interesting information in there but it is unclear what we
 the reader should make of it.] Changes in average density also impact the
 distance between conspecifics: a higher density automatically reduces the
 expected distances between particles, and therefore the distance to the
 nearest neighbour (Section SX).
 Distances between individuals can have a direct effect on their interactions:
 as a phytoplankter creates a gradient of depletion around itself, where
 nutrient concentrations are lower as we get closer to the cell

, competition for nutrient is likely stronger between closer individuals,
 i.e.
 between conspecifics.
 Furthermore, nutrients are not the only elements that can be exchanged
 between particles: for example, sharing the phycosphere, a micro-environment
 where communities of bacteria interact This spatial aggregation created
 by the balance between diffusion and fission rate is also modulated by
 the abundance of a species within the volume of observation.
 Indeed, as we model communities at a steady-state population size (on average),
 population densities are parameters in our model.

, can also impact organisms, both positively and negatively.
 If all species are equivalent with regards to their nutrient requirements
 and consumption, only the distances between individuals, not the identity
 of the individuals, changes the strength (or even existence) of their interacti
on.
 In this case, the interaction structure of the community will emerge from
 the spatial structure of individuals at distances relevant for interactions,
 i.e.
 at the microscale, and intraspecific aggregates make intraspecific interactions
 more likely to be stronger than interspecific interactions at the population
 level, which is itself a crucial parameter in coexistence theory 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 While a high intra-to-interspecific interaction strength ratio is often
 associated with niche differences related to finite resources (nutrient,
 light, vitamins, etc.) in models of community, we propose here that it can
 also emerge from the spatial distribution of individuals, which is affected
 by the trade-off between demographics and hydrodynamics processes.

\begin_layout Standard
Dominances began to decrease at distances above 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{-3}$
\end_inset

 cm, still below the maximum distance for interactions.
 At this distance and above, the balance between heterospecifics and conspecific
s was much more sensitive to different phytoplankton's demographics and
 hydrodynamic traits.
 The species composition of an organism's neighbourhood depended on its
 size: nanophytoplankton organisms mainly shared their volume of potential
 interactions with conspecifics (the dominance index remained close to 1,
 even near the distance threshold, i.e.
 the maximum distance for nutrient depletion volume overlap) while microphytopla
nkton organisms could affect both conspecifics and heterospecifics (the
 dominance index was often below 50% at the distance threshold, i.e.
 a particle's depletion zone probably overlapped with more heterospecifics'
 than conspecifics').
 Microphytoplankters were therefore more likely to share their depletion
 volume with heterospecifics than nanophytoplankters.
 The rate of production of new microphytoplankton conspecifics was not sufficien
t to compensate for the separation velocity due to turbulence and diffusivity,
 even though the diffusion range of microphytoplankters was smaller than
 that of nanophytoplankters.
 There may therefore be different mechanisms at play at the community level
 for microphytoplankton and nanophytoplankton.
 For nanophytoplankton, the spatial structure likely leads to more interactions
 between conspecifics than between heterospecifics.
 The distribution of microphytoplankton species, on the contrary, encourages
 more interactions between heterospecifics.
 If we consider that local interaction strengths are equal within the volume
 of potential interactions, scaling to the population level, we would likely
 observe stronger intra- over interspecific interactions for nanophytoplankton
 (a key factor in coexistence theory, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

) but not necessarily so for microphytoplankton.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All of the above discussion is based on a microphytoplankter's neighbourhood
 as defined by nutrient depletion volumes.
 To simplify the computation, we used maximum volumes of potential interaction,
 corresponding to a diffusive-only flow of nutrient particles.
 But when fluid turbulence increases, nutrient uptake increases due to that
 turbulence, and the size of the depletion zone decreases 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Therefore the volume of potential interactions shrinks in the presence
 of turbulence for microphytoplankton, but not necessarily for nanophytoplankton.
 This is one additional reason why microphytoplankers might still be surrounded
 by conspecifics at ecologically meaningful distances and interacting more
 frequently with them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Up to now, we have only focused on the dominance index, a localized proportion
 of conspecifics.
 However, interactions also depend on the absolute densities of individuals.
 Mechanically, when density decreases, the distances between neighbours
 increase, which explains that the distances between the low-abundance microphyt
oplankters tended to be greater than distances between the more abundant
 nanophytoplankters (Section S6 of the SI).

 The environment is also modified by a bloom: the competition can increase
 due to depletion of nutrients in the whole environment.

 Outside of simply maintaining analytical tractability, we had another,

 This can sometimes lead to an accumulation of key resources close to the
 phytoplankter.
 This will lead to positive spatial correlations between consumers and their
 resources, and we currently do not have theoretical models to represent
 this (short of modelling precisely these bacteria).

Predation is another mechanism that can depend on the spatial distribution
 of organisms.
 Experiments show that predation depends on aggregation, even though patterns
 are not clear (e.g., increase in predation due to clustering, in

), wich creates a new balance between indirect interactions and spatial
 distributions.
 These trade-offs cannot be taken into account if explicit particles are
 not modeled, either representing elements necessary for plankton metabolism,
 or natural enemies.

Our model should be viewed as a first model of spatial distributions of
 multiple phytoplankton species in a realistic, three-dimensional environment
 at the microscale, describing only basic hydrodynamic and demographic processes.
 Using this model, we were able to guesstimate the differences in potential
 intra vs interspecific interactions between species, emerging at the population
 level through spatial distributions

 It is worthwhile to keep in mind that there are numerous remaining features
 of phytoplankton physiology and life histories which we do not cover here,
 but may affect their spatial distributions.
 Many phytoplankters are able to move actively in three-dimensions, which
 can favour cluster formation

 Even those who are believed to move passively actually often move along
 the vertical dimension by regulating their buoyancy

 This clearly calls for viewing our model as a null model to which more
 complex mechanistic models and their spatial outputs can be compared.

 We define 
\begin_inset Formula $u=\frac{r}{\sqrt{8Dt}}$
