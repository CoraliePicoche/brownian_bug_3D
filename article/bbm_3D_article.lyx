\begin_layout Abstract
The coexistence of multiple phytoplankton species despite their reliance
 on similar resources is often explained with mean-field models assuming
 mixed populations.
 In reality, observations of phytoplankton indicate spatial aggregation
 at all scales, including at the scale of a 
\change_deleted -2100369821 1652368393
handful of
\change_inserted -2100369821 1652368394

\change_unchanged
 individuals.
 Local spatial aggregation can hinder competitive exclusion since individuals
 then interact mostly with other individuals of their own species, rather
 than competitors from different species.
 To evaluate how suchmicroscale spatial aggregation could explain phytoplankton
 diversity maintenance, an individual-based, multispecific representation
 of cells in a realistic hydrodynamic environment is required.
 We therefore used as a starting point a mathematically tractable individual-bas
ed model of phytoplankton population dynamics in a viscous and turbulent
 environment, and generalize it here to multiple species and three dimensions.
 The model is studied through both simulations and the derivation of spatial
 moment equations, in connection with point process theory.
 The spatial moment equations show a good match between theory and simulations.
 We parameterized the model based on phytoplankters’ ecological and physical
 characteristics, for both large and small phytoplankton.Defining a zone
 of potential interaction as the overlap between nutrient depletion volumes,
 we show that local species composition—within the range of possible interaction
s—depends on the size class of phytoplankton.
 In large phytoplankton, individuals are surrounded by cells from other
 species, while in small phytoplankton, individuals remain in mostly monospecifi
c clusters.Spatial structure therefore favours intra- over inter-specific
 interactions for small phytoplankton, which likely contributes to coexistence
 mechanisms, while other factors behind diversity maintenance must be examined
 for large phytoplankton.

 Viscosity decreases diffusivity, which can in turn generate a heterogeneous
 landscape by limiting movements and mixing.
 At the other end of the hydrodynamics spectrum, studies on the fluid mechanics
 of phytoplankton show that a turbulent flow, sometimes associated with

 In this framework, population growth is a result of individual births and

 Such aggregation can affect the dynamics of the populations at the community
 level: even when interactions are identical between individuals of the
 same species (conspecifics) or between individuals of different species
 (heterospecifics), the combination of local reproduction and same-scale
 high dispersal limitation and strong interactions leads to stronger intraspecif
ic interactions than interspecific interactions at the population level,
 a major stabilizing mechanism

 This is quite useful to understand how species with marked differences
 coexist.
 However, the difficulty of the coexistence problem is precisely that we
 have to explain how closely related species or genera (e.g., within diatoms),
 many of whom have similar size, buoyancy, chemical composition, etc., manage
 to coexist within a single trophic level.
 This requires to model 
\emph on

 species in spatially realistic environment and measure whether they aggregate

In order to understand the maintenance of highly diverse communities, we
 need to consider models with more species than two opposite archetypes.
 To our knowledge, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 have modeled the only individual-based model including turbulence, but
 not diffusion, for up to 5 species, in which they show that physical characteri
stics of the cell (the inertia related to the size of the organism) allow
 for aggregation and coexistence.
 While taking diversity of organisms into account is the first step towards
 studying coexistence in spatial models, the paucity of studies with multiple
 species can be explained by the computational cost of modeling many, possibly
 interacting, individuals, especially because very large numbers are required
 for phytoplankton organisms which can reach concentrations up to 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{6}$
\end_inset

 C/L.
 Numerical costs could however be partially offset by favoring mathematical
 analyses.
 Indeed, the random distributions of events emerging from a series of stochastic
 processes that constitute the type of model we describe here are known
 as spatial point processes, and can be studied by spatial statistics, via
 the evaluation of aggregated quantities such as correlations between pairs
 of points.

 In spite of this complexity, it remains possible to derive the dynamics
 of pair density functions, which quantify the degree of intra- and interspecifi
c clustering of organisms, via correlations between positions of organisms
 (see Methods).
 This means that in addition to simulations, we can keep track analytically
 of spatial structure.
 Furthermore, because we do not consider direct interactions between particles,
 the multispecies spatial point process that represents the stable state
 of the Brownian Bug model is mathematically a random superposition of spatial
 point processes for each species

 This enables us to derive, in addition to pair correlation functions, analytica

 which are more readily ecologically interpreted than pair density or correlatio

Brownian bug model

\begin_layout Standard
The Brownian Bug Model (BBM) describes the dynamics of particles going through
 demographic processes in a turbulent and viscous environment, in continuous
 space and time.
 It has been developed in its two-dimension, monospecific version in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "young_reproductive_2001"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, which we now extend to three dimensions and to 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 species.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this model, we consider a community of particles, each individual being
 characterized by its species 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 and its position 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}^{T}=(x,\,y,\,z)$
\end_inset

.
 Within a given community, all species are equivalent and share the same
 parameters.
 The population dynamics are modeled by a linear birth-death process with
 birth rate 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 and death rate 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

.
 Each particle independently follows a Brownian motion with diffusivity
 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

, and is advected by a common stochastic flow modeling the turbulence with
 stretching parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

, meaning that the separation 
\begin_inset Formula $s(t)$
\end_inset

 between two points previously on top of each other follows 
\begin_inset Formula $s(t)\varpropto e^{3\gamma t}$
\end_inset

.
 We focus here on ecologically relevant quantities which can be extracted
 from this model, both analytically and numerically.

Range of interaction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we examine particle aggregation or segregation and their potential effects
 on interactions between species, we have to ascertain the volume around
 which a particle can be affected by the presence of other particles, or
 affect other particles.
 We only consider here interactions due to competition for nutrients, and
 therefore need to define a nutrient depletion volume.
 We approximate this volume as the sphere of radius 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $C(r)\leq90\%C_{\infty}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{\infty}$
\end_inset

 the background concentration of the nutrient (hereafter, the concentration
 boundary layer).
 The radius is maximized when the particle is in stagnant water (diffusion
 is the only hydrodynamics process).
 In this case, it corresponds to 
\change_deleted -2100369821 1652777332

As we examine particle clustering or segregation and their potential effects
 on interactions between species, we consider two main processes: direct
 interactions due to, e.g., competition for nutrients, auxotrophy or allotrophy,
 and emerging interactions due to predation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Direct interactions due to a given chemical (whether a resource or a toxin)
 can only take place if the chemical concentration is relevant for the particle.
 We therefore need to define the volume around each particle in which microscale
 interactions can take place before the dilution effect of diffusion and
 turbulence take over.
 This volume will be called the phycosphere hereafter

: clustering is not visible to the naked eye, even when zooming in the observati

 Microphytoplankton distributions are not so easy to analyse as no clusters
 can be detected from basic observations, whether advection is included
 or not (Fig.

 Statistics are therefore needed to go further in detecting patterns of
 aggregation.

 The dominance index is close 1 for small radii: there is always a scale

 to converge at large radii (close to 1cm) to the proportion of the focus
 species in the whole community, as it would for a uniform distribution.
 Patterns differ at intermediate ranges of distances between particles.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the presence of advection, the dominance index starts decreasing for
 a radius between 5 and 10 times lower than when advection is absent, i.e.
 organisms are closer to heterospecifics when their environment is turbulent.
 A quasi-uniform distribution is also reached for smaller radii with advection
 than without.
 Microphytoplankton species start mixing for distances larger than for nanophyto
plankton species irrespective of the hydrodynamic regime surrounding them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a 3-species community with the same initial abundances, microphytoplankton
 dominance indices are between 0.37 and 0.47 at a distance equal to 10 diameters
 of a particle, while it is between 0.80 and 0.94 for nanophytoplankton species
 when advection is present.
 In its absence, dominance indices are all above 0.98 when the 10-diameter
 threshold is reached (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 Microphytoplankton organisms are therefore as likely to share their depletion
 volume with conspecifics as they are with heterospecifics, but only when
 turbulent advection is accounted for, whereas nanophytoplankton organisms
 have almost only conspecifics around them.

 0.033 (for one of the least abundant species), while they are between 0.90
 and 0.85 when advection is not taken into account.
 Nanophytoplankton species, too, are more mixed: dominance indices vary

Differences in spatial distributions are not only due to particle sizes
 which determine properties of demography and turbulence, but also to their
 abundances (here set through initial values).
 When turbulence is taken into account, the dominance index decreases at
 lower radii around a particle when abundance is higher (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Carac_10sp"
plural "false"
caps "false"

 a-b): species which are more abundant tend to be omnipresent when they
 are mixed in the environment, which also makes them more likely to be close
 to a heterospecific, but they still also have more conspecifics close to
 them than the less abundant species.
 When turbulence is absent, the effect of abundance on the dominance index
 decrease is reversed: a 5% decrease is reached for a higher radius when
 species are more abundant for microphytoplankton, which may indicate that
 particle growth offsets diffusion in this case.
 The relationship is more complex for nanophytoplankton: the minimum radius
 for a 5% decrease in dominance index is reached for intermediate abundances;
 there is possibly a trade-off between occupation of the space due to mixing
 by diffusion and growth of particles around their conspecifics.
 The effect of average abundances on the composition of a particle neighbourhood
 within its depletion zone is less marked for nanophytoplankton than for
 microphytoplankton (Fig.

We designed a stochastic, 3D, individual-based model of multiple species
 of particles in a viscous and turbulent flow, and conducted both analytical
 and numerical analyses to quantify spatial correlations in particle distributio
ns.
 We focused on the pair correlation functions and Ripley's K-functions,
 for which numerical and theoretical analyses showed a good agreement, and
 computed the corresponding dominance index to quantify the degree of intraspeci
fic clustering and interspecific mixing.
 Comparing the distributions of organisms of different sizes and demography,
 we showed that the composition of the environment of a particle depends
 on its traits.
 While turbulence always leads to more mixing, microphytoplankters, larger
 cells with a lower diffusivity, encountered heterospecifics at larger distances
 from the particle than nanophytoplankton, but the zone in which competition
 for nutrient was more likely also had a more diverse composition than for
 smaller cells.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Intraspecific clustering at small distances from a particle was a constant
 in our model.
 It shows a balance between diffusivity and turbulence, possibly speeding
 up the separation of particles, and growth rates, which increases their
 aggregation.
 The distance between particles is relevant, as each phytoplanktonic cell
 creates a zone of depletion around itself, where nutrient concentration
 is lower than the ambient concentration 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "karp-boss_nutrient_1996"
literal "false"

\end_inset

: when particles are close enough to decrease concentration of nutrients
 in their respective zones of depletion, competition for nutrients, often
 assumed to be the main direct interaction between primary producers, may
 happen.
 Provided all species are equivalent with regards to their nutrient requirement
 and consumption, the possible interaction structure emerges from the spatial
 structure, itself being a result of the balance between mixing and clustering.
 The results of such balance are size-dependent: nanophytoplankton organisms
 mainly share this space with conspecifics while microphytoplankton organisms
 can affect both conspecifics and heterospecifics.
 It should be noted that interaction via zone of depletion overlap has been
 debated, but usely in the context of a uniform distribution

 and/or with diffusion only

\end_inset

 whereas we show that minimum distances between conspecifics are much lower
 than expected from a uniform distribution (Section SX in SI).
 While competition for nutrient is the most direct interaction between particles
, indirect interactions can also affect phytoplankton growth.
 For instance, each particle is surrounded by a a micro-environment called
 the phycosphere, where communities of bacteria exchange with the particle

 This tends to confirm that microphytoplankton organisms are much more likely
 to interact with heterospecifics than nanophytoplankton individuals, via
 exchanges of compounds necessary for their survival.
 Additional phenomena may however counterbalance the presence of heterospecifics
 near larger cells: these are much more sensitive to increases in turbulence,
 which reduce the volumes of specific zones around them and augment nutrient
 uptakes

 Here, both the phycosphere and the depletion zone sizes are maximized,
 only accounting for diffusive processes.
 If we adjusted depletion zone sizes with turbulence in mind, conspecifics
 would be as predominant for microphytoplankton as they are for nanophytoplankto

 This is crucial for coexistence, as preferential interactions with conspecifics

 While a high intra-to-interspecific interaction strength ratio is mostly
 associated to niche differences, we propose here that, even with equivalent
 species, other mechanisms are at stake: diversity may partly depend on
 the balance between diffusion and growth rates for nanophytoplankton, while
 turbulence might be a key mechanism for microphytoplankton.

While this might be a major mechanism explaining coexistence in nanophytoplankto

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Our model focuses on size as the defining trait of the communities we consider,
 with microphytoplankton being larger than nanophytoplankton by an order
 of magnitude.
 Indeed, size is considered as a major functional trait

, or even average abundances 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "agusti_algal_1987"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 In this model, we focus on a single size per phytoplankton category, which
 defines both the diffusivity and the growth rate of the organisms.
 Smaller sizes lead to a higher diffusivity, i.e.
 less clustering, and a higher growth rate, i.e.
 more clustering, but they also have a smaller zone of depletion.
 In reality, phytoplankton size classes cover a much wider range 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

, and organism diameters may vary greatly even within a single species 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "harrison_cell_2015"

 Taking into account this variability creates new mechanisms sustaining
 diversity: for example, size-based inertia in a chaotic flow creates size-speci
fic aggregates, implying more conspecifics clusters 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 These results complement ours in the sense that they highlight the relevance
 of turbulence at microscale to produce new spatial niches for particles
 of different sizes.
 We can assume that, in our model, introducing a size gradient for species
 within a single phytoplankton community would create more complex spatial
 distributions.
 However, patterns of the dominance index were consistent between organisms:
 more than one order of magnitude between nanophytoplankton and microphytoplankt
on sizes did not change the emergence of clustering at small scales, relevant
 for interactions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Here, interactions are only defined indirectly as we consider distances
 from a particle in which competition for nutrients may happen.
 However, particles interactions can be modeled a much more direct way.
 For instance, birth and death rates can be density-dependent:

\end_inset

 show that when density-dependence and attraction between motile particles
 are defined within a specific range of distances around a particle (defining
 a kernel of interactions), clusters of organisms emerge.
 Even in the absence of demographic processes, attraction between particles
 able to control their location, whether by active movement or by buoyancy/orien
tation regulation, is sufficient to create dense clusters - especially when
 length scales associated to interactions and turbulence are close 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, or when species are colonial and actively create clusters by sticking
 together

 Coloniality is common for phytoplankton, and its absence in our model leading
 to larger cells being close to heterospecifics may also indicate that it
 may have emerged as a way to offst hydrodynamics mixing.

 Intraspecific clustering corresponds to a dominance index close to 1, which
 decreases when interspecific mixing increases.
 The choice of this index was motivated by two reasons: it is at its core
 a proportion of a focus species in a certain volume, i.e.
 a scale-dependent, localized metric bounded between 0 and 1 as opposed
 to other statistics whose values are less directly interpreted, and is
 easy to relate to coexistence theory as it describes the environment of
 a particle in terms of heterospecifics and conspecifics, which can, under
 certain hypotheses that we discuss below, be related to interspecific and
 intraspecific interactions.
 Comparing the distributions of organisms of different sizes and demography,
 we showed that the presence and intensity (Section SX) of turbulence always
 increased mixing, and that the species composition around a particle depended
 on its size, which mechanically determines its hydrodynamics properties
 (diffusivity), and is linked with its ecological characteristics (growth
 rate and density).
 Microphytoplankters (20 to 200

 m), but they were surrounded by more heterospecifics than conspecifics
 within a volume of potential interactions, defined as the maximum distance
 for which nutrient depletion volumes may overlap.
 Microphytoplankters were therefore more likely to interact with individuals
 from other species than with individuals of their own species.
 However, if we consider different distances within the volume of potential
 interactions, this affirmation needs to be nuanced: there was always a
 (potentially small) radius around a particle for which the community remained
 mostly monospecific.
 Variability in species composition of the neighbourhood only intervened
 for larger distances.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We first focus on the smallest distances between particles.
 The nearest neighbour of a particle was always a particle of the same species,
 and the minimum distance between conspecifics was always lower than expected
 for a uniform distribution (Section SX).
 The dominance index remained close to 1 for distances below

\begin_inset Formula $10^{-3}$

 cm for microphytoplankton and nanophytoplankton respectively.
 There was therefore always 
\emph on
some
\emph default
 intraspecific aggregation, i.e.
 conspecifics were always closer than heterospecifics at the lowest distances.
 This is due to the prevalence of demographic processes at individual scales,
 because a particle acts as a source point for other organisms of the same
 species, and hydrodynamics processes do not separate conspecifics fast
 enough to prevent aggregation.
 If we consider that interaction strengths are a smoothly decaying function
 of distance, a common assumption in spatial coexistence models 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
before "e.g., "
key "bolker_spatial_1999,law_population_2003"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, this implies that population-level intraspecific interactions could be
 stronger than interspecific interactions due to intraspecific micro-scale
 aggregation.
 However, the mechanisms of competition at this scale are poorly known,
 likely relying on multiple types of resources with different distributions
 in the environment, effects on the cell, uptakes, etc.
 Rather than weighting much more heavily the potential interactions with
 the closest neighbour(s) through an interaction kernel, we therefore chose
 to define a maximum distance for two particles to possibly affect the concentra
tions of elements in the environment of each other.

[F: There is interesting information in there but it is unclear what we
 the reader should make of it.] Changes in average density also impact the
 distance between conspecifics: a higher density automatically reduces the
 expected distances between particles, and therefore the distance to the
 nearest neighbour (Section SX).
 Distances between individuals can have a direct effect on their interactions:
 as a phytoplankter creates a gradient of depletion around itself, where
 nutrient concentrations are lower as we get closer to the cell

, competition for nutrient is likely stronger between closer individuals,
 i.e.
 between conspecifics.
 Furthermore, nutrients are not the only elements that can be exchanged
 between particles: for example, sharing the phycosphere, a micro-environment
 where communities of bacteria interact This spatial aggregation created
 by the balance between diffusion and fission rate is also modulated by
 the abundance of a species within the volume of observation.

 If all species are equivalent with regards to their nutrient requirements
 and consumption, only the distances between individuals, not the identity
 of the individuals, changes the strength (or even existence) of their interacti
on.
 In this case, the interaction structure of the community will emerge from
 the spatial structure of individuals at distances relevant for interactions,
 i.e.
 at the microscale, and intraspecific aggregates make intraspecific interactions
 more likely to be stronger than interspecific interactions at the population
 level, which is itself a crucial parameter in coexistence theory

.
 While a high intra-to-interspecific interaction strength ratio is often
 associated with niche differences related to finite resources (nutrient,
 light, vitamins, etc.) in models of community, we propose here that it can
 also emerge from the spatial distribution of individuals, which is affected
 by the trade-off between demographics and hydrodynamics processes.

 At this distance and above, the balance between heterospecifics and conspecific
s was much more sensitive to different phytoplankton's demographics and
 hydrodynamics traits.
 The species composition of a particle's neighbourhood depended on its size:
 nanophytoplankton organisms mainly shared their volume of 
\change_inserted -2100369821 1652857090
potential 
\change_unchanged
interactions with conspecifics (the dominance index remained close to 1,

 the maximum distance for nutrient depletion volume overlap
\change_unchanged
) while microphytoplankton organisms could affect both conspecifics and
 heterospecifics (the dominance index was often below 50% at the overlap
 threshold, i.e.
 a particle's depletion zone probably overlapped with more heterospecifics'
 than conspecifics').
 Microphytoplankters were therefore more likely to

\change_deleted -2100369821 1652857238

\change_unchanged
.
 The rate of production of new
\change_inserted -2100369821 1652857268

\change_unchanged
 conspecifics was not sufficient to compensate for the separation velocity
 due to turbulence and diffusivity, even though the diffusion range of microphyt
oplankters was smaller than that of nanophytoplankters.
 There may therefore be different mechanisms at play at the community level
 for microphytoplankton and nanophytoplankton.
 For nanophytoplankton, the

, which is key in coexistence theory

 For microphytoplankton, while we have shown that interactions at the individual
 level may be stronger with a conspecific, interactions are more frequent
 with heterospecifics.

\change_inserted -2100369821 1652858256
 The distribution of microphytoplankton species, on the contrary, encourages
 more frequent interactions between heterospecifics.
 If we consider that local interaction strengths are equal within the volume
 of potential interactions, scaling to the population level, we would likely
 observe stronger intra- over interspecific interaction strengths for nanophytop
lankton (a key factor in coexistence theory, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 This is not so clear for microphytoplankton.
 If we consider that local interaction strengths are negatively correlated
 with distances between organisms, the balance between local strength and
 frequency is unknown, and the structure of interactions at the population
 level that could emerge from the spatial structure
\change_deleted -2100369821 1652858178
 There is therefore a balance between strength and frequency of interactions
 which precludes direct conclusions regarding the relative strengths of

The separation can even reach the maximum threshold for interactions to
 happen: there might therefore be a point for which a particle is only surrounde

\change_inserted -2100369821 1652863271

 effect:

 means that it has more heterospecifics in its neighbourhood than a low-density

F: I feel that the whole paragraph could be made more precise – we can discuss
 this.
 I have the feeling that you want to use another criterion than dominance
 to outline how interactions potentially play out, but because the criterion
 used to determine whether interactions (min distance to heterospecifics,
 mean distance, ...) could occur is not made explicit, a number of sentences
 are inevitably a little vague.
 
\change_inserted -2100369821 1652864327
CP: Rephrased, but still not good.
 Would need your advise.
 The goal is to show that blooming population may have a different behaviour
 which would require nutrient modeling.
 I actually do not see which (other) criterion I would use here.
 Transition to the last paragraph about other ways to model interactions
 is now more obvious, though.

Our model focuses on size as the defining trait of the communities we consider,
 with microphytoplankton being larger than nanophytoplankton by an order
 of magnitude.
 Indeed, size is considered as a major functional trait

, correlated with other capacities such as growth rate or nutrient affinities

 In this model, smaller sizes lead to a higher diffusivity, i.e.
 less clustering, a higher growth rate, i.e.
 more clustering, a higher density, i.e.
 lower distances between particles, but they also lead to a smaller zone
 of depletion.
 These properties may all interact and balance each other differently with
 different sizes.
 In reality, phytoplankton size classes cover a much wider range than showed
 here: nanophytoplankton sizes vary between 2 and 20

 Taking into account this variability creates new mechanisms sustaining

 were based on their size, monospecific aggregates are created by the different
 inertia related to size in a chaotic flow

 This show that considering more size classes would lead to more niche different
iation as escape from competitive exclusion is easier when species have
 different requirements or hydrodynamics properties.
 On the contrary, our main focus here was to study the possible interaction
 structure of a community made of equivalent species, all sharing the same
 reproduction and diffusion rates.

Another, possibly more relevant, way of modeling interactions would be to
 introduce resource points in the cube, which could in turn change the reproduct
ion or death rate of individuals.
 Such mechanism is mostly adequate for interactions due to competition for
 nutrients, but its adequacy is less clear-cut than may be thought.
 If the resource points risk being depleted, this entails a negative spatial
 correlation between organisms and their resources

 However, there are additional complexities in phytoplankton.
 For example, the phycosphere, a micro-environment at the periphery of a
 phytoplankton particle where communities of bacteria interact

 As bacteria feed on compounds leaking from the phytoplankter, the gradient
 of resources is opposite to the gradient of nutrient: resources shared
 between phytoplankters and bacteria are maximum at the surface of the phytoplan
kter and reduce with the distance from the organism.
 Volumes of potential interactions, and potential interactions themselves,
 may therefore vary depending on the mechanism considered.
