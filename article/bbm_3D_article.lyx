Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Phytoplankton communities are among the most important photosynthetic groups
 on Earth, being at the bottom of the marine food chain, and responsible
 for half the global primary production

\end_inset

.
 Their contribution to ecosystem functions is only matched by their significance
 for more theoretical studies focusing on coexistence within a single trophic
 level.
 Indeed, phytoplankton communities are characterized by a surprisingly high
 biodiversity (up to hundreds of species within multiple genera and even
 classes in volumes as small as 10 mL), an observation which has led to
 the formulation of the so-called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

paradox of the plankton
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "hutchinson_paradox_1961"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 This term refers to the conflict between the observed diversity maintenance
 of species competing for similar resources in a seemingly homogeneous environme
nt, and theoretical expectations of a few species outcompeting the others.
 Phytoplankton models for coexistence are now as diverse as their model
 organism 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "record_paradox_2014"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Proposed mechanisms to escape from competitive exclusion are based on the
 general literature on coexistence, which includes non-linear responses
 to the environment in a temporally fluctuating environment 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "li_effects_2016,chesson_updates_2018"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, in a nonspatial setting, i.e.
 keeping the premise of a homogeneous environment.
 Such assumption needs to be challenged, as we know that spatialized models
 including a heterogeneous environment and/or non-mixed populations can
 lead to highly different outcomes from their nonspatial counterparts 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "law_population_2003"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 This is even more relevant as field observations themselves have higlighted
 phytoplankton patchiness for more than a century 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "bainbridge_size_1957"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, from the macro- to the micro-scale

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Phytoplankton patchiness can at least be partly explained by the hydrodynamics
 of their environment 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "martin_phytoplankton_2003"
literal "false"

\end_inset

: their size being mostly below the size of the smallest eddy (i.e., the Kolmogoro
v scale) in a typical environment such as the ocean, they are mostly embedded
 in viscous micro-structures at the individual level 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "peters_effects_2000"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, but are still displaced by a common flow at the larger scale, due to turbulenc
e.
 Viscosity decreases diffusivity, which can in turn generate an heterogeneous
 landscape by limiting movements and mixing.
 On the other end of the hydrodynamics spectrum, studies on the fluid mechanics
 of phytoplankton show that a turbulent flow, sometimes associated with
 other phenomena such as motility can encourage the formation of clusters

\end_inset

.
 Turbulence also affects phytoplankton organism interactions with their
 environment 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "guasto_fluid_2012"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, by increasing nutrient consumption 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "peters_effects_2006"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and encounter rates with either potential partners or predators 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "kiorboe2018mechanistic"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, therefore affecting organism growths: there can be an effect of the general
 movements of water on the ability of individuals to survive and reproduce,
 whether sexually or asexually (by fission).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This leads us to consider demography in the context of environmental variation
 created by hydrodynamics processes.
 Indeed, including simple processes such as reproduction and death in a
 spatial model can also create a patchy environment: individuals are born
 close to their parents, whereas mortality is a global phenomenon, which
 can lead to clusters of `family' by itself 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "young_reproductive_2001"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 When hydrodynamics processes are considered, provided that the separation
 between parents and offsprings is not too fast to offset family aggregation,
 i.e.
 if turbulence and/or diffusion are not too high, including individual reproduct
ion encourage a strong spatial structure by itself 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "young_reproductive_2001,bouderbala_3d_2018"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Observed patchiness can therefore be reproduced in models taking into account
 basic mechanisms governing the life of phytoplankton organisms.
 This can have a strong impact if we consider the community level: intraspecific
 clustering itself is important as it increases the likelihood of a particle
 interacting with a conspecific as opposed to an heterospecific.
 Knowing that a high intra-to-interspecific interaction strength is associated
 with coexistence in models 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "levine_importance_2009,barabas_self-regulation_2017"

\end_inset

 and often observed in the field 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "adler_competition_2018,picoche_strong_2020"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, species-specific clustering might be key to diversity maintenance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, spatial models of individuals at the microscale rarely include
 multiple species 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "bouderbala_3d_2018,breier_emergence_2018"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, but it is clear that individual clustering can be enforced at the species
 level, as individuals of the same species share common parameters which
 rule their reaction to their environment.
 For example, experiments often relate a major trait of phytoplankton organisms,
 their size, to the viscosity of their environment 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "guadayol_microrheology_2021"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, reaction to turbulence 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "barry_shear-induced_2015"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, or growth rates 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "edwards_allometric_2012"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 On a more theoretical point of view, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "barton_impact_2014"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 have already shown that coexistence between organisms of different sizes
 can be increased by the presence of turbulence.
 While taking diversity of organisms into account is the first step towards
 studying coexistence in spatial models, the lack of studies with multiple
 species can be explained by the computational cost of modeling many individuals
, especially as very large numbers are required for phytoplankton organisms
 which can reach 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{6}$
\end_inset

 individuals per liter, for many species.
 Numerical costs could be partially offset by favoring mathematical analyses
 of spatial models, which can predict spatial distributions in many scenarii.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mathematical analyses of spatial models can quantify the degree of clustering
 in the environment by measuring correlations between positions of pairs
 (or more) of particles 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "illian2008statistical"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 A model of individuals randomly reproducing and moving in space, which
 is the type we have focused on here, is also called a spatial point process,
 for which a master equation can often be derived 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "dieckmann_relaxation_2000,birch_master_2006"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 to describe the behaviour of the particles through time.
 The moment measures, which can be seen as the extension of moments of random
 variables, can also be used to compute the expected characteristics of
 the spatial distribution of individuals 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "plank_spatial_2015"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 However, the moments of a process are mainly mathematical quantities which
 then need to be related to ecological processes (see, e.g., 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "bolker_spatial_1999"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, in which possible spatial strategies for population survival are identified),
 an endeavour often lacking in phytoplankton spatial models.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, we present the Brownian Bug Model (BBM), a 3D, individual-based model
 including turbulence and diffusion, as well as births and deaths, based
 on 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "young_reproductive_2001"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, with parameter values adapted to the physical properties of the environment
 and the organisms we study.
 We differentiate between organisms of different sizes and simulate multiple
 species within a single community.
 We are able to provide both numerical simulations and analytical formula
 to quantify the degree of intra- and interspecific clustering of organisms,
 which enables us to characterize the composition of their vicinity for
 different distances from a particle, and use this information to make informed
 guess about mechanisms supporting diversity within different communities
 of phytoplankton.

Brownian bug model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Brownian Bug Model (BBM) describes the dynamics of particles going through
 demographic processes in a turbulent and viscous environment, in continuous
 space and time.
 It has been developed in its 2-dimension, monospecific version in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "young_reproductive_2001"

\end_inset

, which we now extend to 3 dimensions and to 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 species having specific demographic and hydrodynamic properties.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this model, we consider several populations of particles, each individual
 being characterized by its species 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 and its position 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}^{T}=(x\,y\,z)$
\end_inset

.
 The population dynamics are modeled by a linear birth-death process with
 birth rate 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 and death rate 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

.
 Each particle independently follows a Brownian motion with diffusivity
 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

, and is advected by a common stochastic flow modeling the turbulence with
 stretching parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

, meaning that the separation 
\begin_inset Formula $s(t)$
\end_inset

 between two points previously on top of each other follows 
\begin_inset Formula $s(t)\varpropto e^{3\gamma t}$
\end_inset

.
 We focus here on ecologically relevant quantities which can be extracted
 from this model, both analytically and numerically.

Such combination of a branching process with a Brownian motion is also called
 a superprocess (Adler 199,7 Young 2001 -the Hawaii paper), and the addition
 of a global stochastic flow is formalized from a probabilist point of view
 in Skoulakis and Adler (2001).

 The state of the system at time

 It is a realization of the spatial point process deriving from a stochastic,
 spatialized individual-based model such as the Brownian Bug Model.
 One of the most common methods to describe a spatial point process is through
 its moments, that can be theoretically derived and allow us to check our
 simulations.
 Here, we also present the dominance index, on which we focus later on for
 its ecological relevance.

\begin_inset Formula $V(W)=L^{3}$

As we examine particle aggregation or segregation and their potential effects

 which a particle can be affected by the presence of other particles, or
 affect other particles.
 We only consider here interactions due to competition for nutrients, and
 therefore need to define a nutrient depletion volume.
 We approximate this volume as the sphere of radius 
\begin_inset Formula $r$

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $C(r)\leq90\%C_{\infty}$

\begin_inset Formula $C_{\infty}$

 the background concentration of the nutrient (hereafter, the concentration
 boundary layer).
 The radius is maximized when the particle is in stagnant water (diffusion
 is the only hydrodynamics process).
 In this case, it corresponds to 10 times the radius of the particle

Direct interactions due to a given chemical (whether a resource or a toxin)
 can only take place if the chemical concentration is relevant for the particle.
 We therefore need to define the volume around each particle in which microscale

 turbulence take over.
 This volume will be called the phycosphere hereafter

Dominances indices all follow a similar pattern.
 The dominance index is close 1 for small radii: there is always a scale

In the presence of advection, species tend to start mixing at lower radii
 than in the absence of advection: the dominance index starts decreasing
 for a radius at least ten times lower than when advection is absent.
 A quasi-uniform distribution is also reached for smaller radii than in
 the absence of advection.
 With and without turbulence, microphytoplankton starts mixing for distances
 larger than for nanophytoplankton.

\begin_layout Standard
In a 3-species community with the same initial abundances, microphytoplankton
 dominance indices are around 0.4-0.5 at a distance equal to 10 diameters
 of a particle, while it is around 0.9 for nanophytoplankton species when
 advection is present.
 When there is no turbulence, dominances indices are both close to 1 when
 the 10-diameter threshold is reached.
 Microphytoplankton organisms are as likely to share their depletion zone
 with conspecifics or heterospecifics, whereas nanophytoplankton have almost
 only conspecifics around them in this volume.

Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We designed a stochastic, 3D, multispecific model of particles in a viscous
 and turbulent flow, and conducted both analytical and numerical analyses
 to quantify spatial correlations in particle distributions.
 We focused on the second moment of the spatial point process, or pair correlati
on function, for which numerical and theoretical analyses showed a good
 agreement.
 From the pcf and corresponding Ripley's function, we extracted the dominance
 index to quantify the degree of interspecific mixing.
 Comparing the behaviour of organisms of different sizes and demography,
 we showed that proximity between particles of different communities depends
 on the characteristics of the particles.
 While turbulence always lead to more mixing, microphytoplankton, larger
 cells with a lower diffusivity, encountered heterospecifics at larger distances
 from the particle than nanophytoplankton, but still within what we defined
 as a possible zone of nutrient depletion surrounding a particle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Intraspecific clustering at small distances from a particle is a constant
 in our model.
 It shows a balance between diffusivity and turbulence, possibly speeding
 up the separation of particles, and growth rates, which increases their
 aggregation.
 The distance between particles is relevant, as each phytoplanktonic cell
 creates a zone of depletion around itself, where nutrient concentration
 is lower than the ambient concentration 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

literal "false"

\end_inset

: when particles are close enough to decrease concentration of nutrients
 in their respective zones of depletion, competition for nutrients, often
 assumed to be the main direct interaction between primary producers, may
 happen.
 The equilibrium between mixing and clustering then affects the balance
 between intra- and interspecific interactions.
 The effects of such balance are size-dependent: intraspecific clusters
 are larger for microphytoplankton but particles still mix enough to have
 to share their depletion zone with heterospecifics.
 Nanophytoplankton organisms mainly share this space with conspecifics while
 microphytoplankton organisms can affect both conspecifics and heterospecifics.
 It should be noted that interaction via zone of depletion overlap has been
 debated, but usely in the context of a uniform distribution and/or with
 diffusion only

 On the contrary, models of microscale spatial distribution show lower distances
 between particles than expected from a uniform distribution

 While competition for nutrient is the most direct interaction between particles
, indirect interactions can also affect phytoplankton growth.
 For instance, each particle is surrounded by a a micro-environment called
 the phycosphere, where communities of bacteria exchange with the particle
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "seymour_zooming_2017"

\end_inset

: we can assume that sharing such communities could impact, both positively
 and negatively, an organism.
 For a particle of microphytoplankton with a diameter of 50

 it is nearly non-existent for particles below 3

 m.
 This tends to confirm that microphytoplankton organisms are much more likely
 to interact with heterospecifics than nanophytoplankton individuals, via
 exchanges of compounds necessary for their survival.
 However, larger cells are affected by additional phenomena: they are much
 more sensitive to increases in turbulence, which reduce the volumes of
 specific zones around them

 and augment nutrient uptakes.
 Here, both the phycosphere and the depletion zone sizes are computed with
 diffusion only in mind.
 It is possible that, if we determined adjusted depletion zone sizes, conspecifi
cs would be as predominant for microphyotplankton as they are for nanophytoplank
ton.
 This is crucial for coexistence, as preferential interactions with conspecifics
 is a requirement for the maintenance of diverse particles

: diversity may therefore be more dependent on the balance between diffusion
 and growth rates for nanophytoplankton, while turbulence might be key mecanism
 for microphytoplankton 
\begin_inset Note Note

While this might be a major mechanism explaining coexistence in nanophytoplankto
n communities, diversity in microphytoplankton communities needs to be sustained
 by other phenomena which are not presented here, such as predation or parasitis
m, precise niche differences between species (article on light repartition),
 or different functional traits (XXX).

Our model focuses on size as the defining trait of the communities we consider.
 This is in line with many studies which take size as a major functional
 trait

 In this model, we focus on a single size per phytoplankton category, which
 defines both the diffusivity and the growth rate of the organisms.
 Smaller sizes lead to a higher diffusivity, i.e.
 less clustering, and a higher growth rate, i.e.
 more clustering, but they also have a smaller zone of depletion.
 In reality, phytoplankton size classes cover a much wider range 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "boyce_mice_2015"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, and organism diameters may vary greatly even within a single species.
 Taking into account this variability creates new mechanisms sustaining
 diversity: for example, size-based inertia in a chaotic flow creates size-speci
fic aggregates, implying more conspecifics clusters

 These results complement ours in the way they highlight the relevance of
 turbulence at microscale to produce new spatial niches for particles of
 different sizes.
 We can assume that, in our model, introducing a size gradient for species
 within a single phytoplankton community would create more complex spatial
 distributions.
 At the same time, the conspecifics clustering observed at small scales
 seems to be quite unsensitive to variations in sizes (more than one order
 of magnitude between nanophytoplankton and microphytoplankton): there would
 still be probably, even slightly, more conspecifics than heterospecifics
 at scales relevant for interactions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, interactions are only defined indirectly as we consider distances
 from a particle in which competition for nutrients may happen.
 However, particles interactions can be modeled a much more direct way.
 For instance, birth and death rates can be density-dependent: 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "bouderbala_simulation_2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 shows that when density-dependence and attraction between motile particles
 are defined within a specific range of distances around a particle (the
 kernel of interaction) clusters of organisms emerge.
 Even in the absence of demographic processes, attraction between particles
 able to propulse themselves is sufficient to create dense clusters at the
 micro-scale in a turbulent environment - especially when length scales
 associated to interactions and turbulence are close 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "breier_emergence_2018"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, or when species are colonial and actively create clusters by sticking
 together 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "kiorboe_coagulation_1990"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 This is common for microphytoplankton: our model should be considered a
 null model for independent cells, but can also highlight the importance
 of coloniality for larger cells to be able to be closer to conspecifics.
 Our model is therefore another step in the building of meso- or micro-scales
 models to describe phytoplankton distribution, with phenomena adapted to
 this scale, by introducing a multispecific community, with organisms defined
 by their traits (sizes, average concentrations in the environment).
 Introducing new traits and/or spatial heterogeneity in terms of environmental
 quality could constitute help to understand the observed patchiness of
 phytoplankton, and the way their diversity may be sustained by phenomena
 that cannot be considered with usual mean-field models.
