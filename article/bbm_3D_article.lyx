\begin_layout Abstract
The coexistence of multiple phytoplankton species despite their reliance
 on similar resources is often explained with mean-field models assuming
 mixed populations.
 In reality, observations of phytoplankton indicate spatial aggregation
 at all scales, including at the scale of a few individuals.
 Local spatial aggregation can hinder competitive exclusion since individuals
 then interact mostly with other individuals of their own species, rather
 than competitors from different species.
 To evaluate how microscale spatial aggregation might explain phytoplankton
 diversity maintenance, an individual-based, multispecific representation
 of cells in a hydrodynamic environment is required.
 We formulate a three-dimensional and multispecific individual-based model
 of phytoplankton population dynamics at the Kolmogorov scale.
 The model is studied through both simulations and the derivation of spatial
 moment equations, in connection with point process theory.
 The spatial moment equations show a good match between theory and simulations.
 We parameterized the model based on phytoplankters
\begin_inset Quotes ers
\end_inset

 ecological and physical characteristics, for both large and small phytoplankton.
 Defining a zone of potential interactions as the overlap between nutrient
 depletion volumes, we show that local species composition—within the range
 of possible interactions—depends on the size class of phytoplankton.
 In large phytoplankton, individuals are surrounded by cells from other
 species, while in small phytoplankton, individuals remain in mostly monospecifi
c clusters.
 Spatial structure therefore favours intra- over inter-specific interactions
 for small phytoplankton, which likely contributes to coexistence mechanisms.
 Other factors behind diversity maintenance must be examined for large phytoplan
kton.

 Their contribution to ecosystem functions is only matched by their contribution
 to biodiversity.
 Indeed, phytoplankton communities are characterized by a surprisingly high
 biodiversity.
 For example, a single sample as small as a few mL can contain up to seventy
 species

 For instance, we found that a phytoplankton community dynamics model with
 environmental fluctuations and storage effect still requires extra niche
 differentiation for coexistence, which manifests in stronger intraspecific
 than interspecific interactions

 However, it is not clear that we should resort to hidden niches to explain
 phytoplankton coexistence, as most models also make hidden simplifying
 assumptions that could be relaxed.
 One that we relax here is mean-field dynamics at the microscale.
 Indeed, field observations have revealed phytoplankton patchiness for more
 than a century

Phytoplankton patchiness can at least be partly explained by the hydrodynamics
 of their environment: the size of these organisms is mostly below the size
 of the smallest eddy (i.e., the Kolmogorov scale).
 In a typical aquatic environment such as the ocean, phytoplankton individuals
 are embedded in viscous micro-structures

 Phytoplankton organisms therefore live in an environment where fluid viscosity
 dominates at the scale of an individual but turbulent dispersion dominates
 on length scales characteristic of a small population of those individuals

 This is useful as an explanation of how species with marked differences
 might coexist.
 The difficulty of the coexistence problem, however, is that we have to
 explain how closely related species or genera (e.g., within diatoms), many
 of whom have similar size, buoyancy, chemical composition, etc., manage
 to coexist within a single trophic level.
 This requires modelling 
\emph on
similar

 species in a spatially realistic environment and objectively quantifying
 whether they aggregate or segregate in space.

To do so, we build a multispecific version of the Brownian Bug Model (BBM)
 of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "young_reproductive_2001"

\end_inset

, an individual-based model which includes an advection process mimicking
 a turbulent fluid flow, passive diffusion of organisms, as well as stochastic
 birth and death processes.
 The initial version of this model 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "young_reproductive_2001"

\end_inset

 coupled limited dispersal and local reproduction with ocean-like microscale
 hydrodynamics, and showed spatial clusters of individuals of the same species.
 The original BBM was limited to a single species and was illustrated with
 two-dimensional simulations.
 The model was not strongly quantitative 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "picoche_rescience_2022"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 in the sense that parameters were not informed by current knowledge on
 phytoplankton biology (numbers of cells per liter, diffusion characteristics,
 etc.).
 As phytoplankton organisms live in a three-dimensional environment, informing
 the model with more realistic parameters required us to shift to three
 dimensions.
 We also extend the model to multiple species, and consider two size classes
 for our phytoplankton communities, which are either made of nanophytoplankton
 (3

 We populate each community with 3 to 10 different species.

\begin_layout Standard
The Brownian Bug model (in its original single-species form as in the multispeci
es version considered here) is linked to spatial branching processes.
 Without advection, it combines a continuous-time, discrete-state model
 for population growth and a continuous-time, continuous-space Brownian
 motion for particle diffusion 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "birch_master_2006"

\end_inset

 It is further complexified by a turbulent flow in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "young_reproductive_2001,picoche_rescience_2022"

\end_inset

 as well as here.
 In spite of this complexity, it remains possible to derive the dynamics
 of pair density functions, which quantify the degree of intra- and interspecifi
c clustering of organisms, via correlations between positions of organisms
 (see Methods).
 Thus we can understand emergent spatial structure in analytic details and
 compare these predictions with the results from three-dimensional simulations.
 Furthermore, because we do not consider direct interactions between organisms,
 the multispecies spatial point process that represents the stable state
 of the BBM is a random superposition of spatial point processes for each
 species 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 This enables us to derive, in addition to pair correlation functions, analytica
l formulas for the species composition of the neighbourhood of an individual,
 which are more readily ecologically interpreted than pair density or correlatio
n functions.

One of the useful methods to characterize a spatial point process is through
 its spatial moments (see examples in Section S2 of the SI).
 These can be theoretically derived and used to check simulations.
 The spatial moments of a process are, however, merely statistical indicators
 which then need to be related to more easily ecologically interpretable
 quantities.
 This is the role of the dominance index, which we present below.

\begin_inset Formula $\widehat{N_{i}(W)}$

As we examine individual aggregation and its potential effects on interactions
 between species, we have to ascertain the volume in which an individual
 can be affected by the presence of other individuals, or affect other individua
ls.
 We only consider here interactions due to competition for nutrients, and
 therefore need to define a nutrient depletion volume.
 We approximate this volume as the sphere of radius 
\begin_inset Formula $r$

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{\infty}$

 the background concentration of the nutrient.
 The radius of this nutrient depletion volume is maximized when the individual
 is in stagnant water (diffusion is the only hydrodynamic process).
 In this case, it corresponds to 10 times the radius of the individual

 Statistics are therefore needed to go further in detecting patterns of

).
 The dominance index is close to 1 for small distances: there is always
 a scale at which an organism is surrounded almost only by conspecifics.
 The index then decreases sharply to converge at large distances (close
 to 1 cm) to the proportion of the focus species in the whole community,
 as it would for a uniform distribution.
 Patterns differ at intermediate ranges of distances between organisms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the presence of advection, the dominance index starts decreasing for
 a distance between 5 and 10 times lower than when advection is absent,
 which indicates that organisms are closer to heterospecifics when their
 environment is turbulent.
 A quasi-uniform distribution is also reached for smaller distances with
 advection than without.
 Microphytoplankton species start mixing for distances larger than for nanophyto
plankton species irrespective of the hydrodynamic regime surrounding them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a 3-species community with the same initial abundances, in the presence
 of advection, microphytoplankton dominance indices are between 0.37 and
 0.47 at the distance threshold for potential interactions, while they are
 between 0.80 and 0.94 for nanophytoplankton species.
 In the absence of turbulence, dominance indices are all above 0.98 when
 the distance threshold is reached (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Dominance-3sp"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 Microphytoplankton organisms are therefore as likely to share their depletion
 volume with conspecifics as they are with heterospecifics, but only when
 turbulent advection is accounted for, whereas nanophytoplankton organisms
 always have almost only conspecifics around them.

Differences in spatial distributions are not only due to organism sizes,
 which determine their demographic and hydrodynamic properties, but also
 to their abundances (here set through initial values).
 In the presence of turbulence, the threshold distance at which dominance
 falls below 95% is smaller for more abundant species (Fig.

 a-b).
 Abundant species tend to be present nearly everywhere when they are mixed
 in the environment.
 Therefore, they are also more likely to be close to a heterospecific, but
 still have more conspecifics close to them than the less abundant species
 (

Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We designed a stochastic, three-dimension, individual-based model of the
 spatial distribution of multiple species in a viscous and turbulent flow.
 We conducted both mathematical analyses and numerical simulations to quantify
 spatial correlations in organism distributions.
 We focused on the pair correlation function and Ripley's 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

-function, for which numerical and theoretical analyses showed a good agreement,
 and extracted a more ecologically-oriented metric from them, i.e.
\change_inserted -2100369821 1663752660
,
\change_unchanged
 the dominance index.
 This statistic is the 
\shape italic
local
\shape default
 average ratio of conspecifics, i.e., the number of organisms of the focal
 species in the neighbourhood of an individual of the same species, divided
 by the total number of organisms in that neighbourhood.
 Intraspecific clustering corresponds to a dominance index close to 1, which
 decreases when interspecific mixing increases.
 The choice of this index was motivated by two reasons: (1) it is at its
 core a proportion of a focus species in a certain volume, i.e.
 a scale-dependent, localized metric bounded between 0 and 1 as opposed
 to other statistics whose values are less directly interpreted, and (2)
 it is easy to relate to coexistence theory as it describes the environment
 of an organism in terms of heterospecifics and conspecifics, which can,
 under certain hypotheses that we discuss below, be related to interspecific
 and intraspecific interactions.
 Comparing the distributions of organisms of different sizes, we showed
 that the presence and intensity (Section S7 of the SI) of turbulence always
 increased mixing, and that the species composition around an organism depended
 on its size, which mechanically determines its hydrodynamic properties
 (diffusivity), and is linked with its ecological characteristics (growth
 rate and density).
 Microphytoplankters (20 to 200 µm), larger cells with lower diffusivity,
 growth rate and abundance, were on average further away from other cells,
 due to their lower concentrations (Figure S10 of the SI), than nanophytoplankte
rs (2 to 20 µm).
 However, they were surrounded by more heterospecifics than conspecifics
 within a volume of potential interactions, whose radius is defined as the
 maximum distance for which nutrient depletion volumes of two different
 individuals may overlap.
 If we consider that interactions between species (not modelled here), could
 occur with equal probability at all distances within the volume of potential
 interactions, we would conclude that microphytoplankters are more likely
 to interact with individuals from other species than with individuals of
 their own species.
 However, this affirmation is conditional upon interactions at 10 cell diameters
 from an individual being equally likely than at 1 diameter from an individual.
 If we keep in mind that interactions are more likely or stronger at very
 short distances, microphytoplankters may still experience more frequent
 effects of conspecifics than heterospecifics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To see this, let us first focus on the smallest distances between organisms.
 The nearest neighbour of an organism was always an organism of the same
 species, and the minimum distance between conspecifics was always lower
 than expected for a uniform distribution (Section S6 of the SI).
 The dominance index remained close to 1 for distances below 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{-2}$
\end_inset

 cm or 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{-3}$
\end_inset

 cm for microphytoplankton and nanophytoplankton respectively.
 There was therefore always 
\emph on
some
\emph default
 intraspecific aggregation, i.e.
 conspecifics were always closer than heterospecifics at the lowest distances.
 This is due to the prevalence of demographic processes at individual scales,
 because an individual acts as a source point for other organisms of the
 same species, and hydrodynamic processes do not separate conspecifics fast
 enough to prevent aggregation.
 If we consider that interaction strengths are a smoothly decaying function
 of distance, a common assumption in spatial coexistence models 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
before "e.g., "
key "bolker_spatial_1999,law_population_2003"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, this implies that population-level intraspecific interactions could be
 stronger than interspecific interactions due to intraspecific micro-scale
 aggregation.
 However, the mechanisms of competition at this scale are poorly known,
 likely relying on multiple types of resources with different distributions
 in the environment, effects on the cell, uptakes, etc.
 Rather than weighting much more heavily the potential interactions with
 the closest neighbour(s) through an interaction kernel, we therefore chose
 conservatively to define a maximum distance for two organisms to possibly
 affect the concentrations of elements in the environment of each other.
 We consider that, at all distances below this threshold, interactions could
 happen between organisms.
 We continue the discussion with that simplification in mind, and explicitly
 mention when it is relaxed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dominance indices began to decrease at distances above 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{-3}$
\end_inset

 cm, still below the maximum distance for interactions.
 At this distance and above, the balance between heterospecifics and conspecific
s was much more sensitive to different phytoplankters' demographic and hydrodyna
mic traits.
 The species composition of an organism's neighbourhood depended on its
 size: nanophytoplankton organisms mainly shared their volume of potential
 interactions with conspecifics (the dominance index remained close to 1,
 even near the distance threshold, i.e.
 the maximum distance for the overlap of nutrient depletion volumes) while
 microphytoplankton organisms could affect both conspecifics and heterospecifics
 (the dominance index was often below 50% at the distance threshold, i.e.
 
\change_inserted -2100369821 1663762122
an individual's
\change_deleted -2100369821 1663762117
a particle's
\change_unchanged
 depletion zone probably overlapped with more heterospecifics' than conspecifics
').
 Microphytoplankters were therefore more likely to share their depletion
 volume with heterospecifics than nanophytoplankters.
 The rate of production of new microphytoplankton conspecifics was not sufficien
t to compensate for the mixing induced by turbulence and diffusivity, even
 though the diffusion range of microphytoplankters was smaller than that
 of nanophytoplankters.
 There may therefore be different mechanisms at play at the community level
 for microphytoplankton and nanophytoplankton to maintain coexistence.
 For nanophytoplankton, the spatial structure likely leads to more interactions
 between conspecifics than between heterospecifics.
 The
\change_inserted -2100369821 1663762208
 spatial
\change_unchanged
 distribution of microphytoplankton species, on the contrary, encourages
 more interactions between heterospecifics.
 If we consider that local interaction strengths are equal within the volume
 of potential interactions, scaling to the population level, we would likely
 observe stronger intra- over interspecific interactions for nanophytoplankton
 (a key factor in coexistence theory, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

) but not necessarily so for microphytoplankton (however, see Section S8
 in the SI, based on the Lotka-Volterra model).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All of the above discussion is based on a microphytoplankter's neighbourhood
 in its nutrient depletion volume.
 To simplify the computation, we used maximum volumes of potential interactions,
 corresponding to a diffusive-only flow of nutrient particles.
 But when fluid turbulence increases, nutrient uptake increases, and the
 size of the depletion zone decreases 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "karp-boss_nutrient_1996"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The proportion of change in the depletion volume increases with the size
 of organism: a 10 µm-diameter organism might not experience any change,
 while the uptake of a 100 µm-diameter organism would increase by at least
 50% 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "karp-boss_nutrient_1996"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Therefore the volume of potential interactions shrinks in the presence
 of turbulence for microphytoplankton, but not necessarily for nanophytoplankton.
 This is one additional reason why microphytoplankers might still be surrounded
 by conspecifics at ecologically meaningful distances and interacting more
 frequently with them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Up to now, we have only focused on the dominance index, a localized proportion
 of conspecifics.
 However, interactions also depend on the absolute densities of individuals.
 Mechanically, when density decreases, the distances between neighbours
 increase, which explains that the distances between the low-abundance microphyt
oplankters tended to be greater than distances between the more abundant
 nanophytoplankters (Section S6 of the SI).
 Explicit mathematical models using pair densities to express interaction
 rates 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

\end_inset

 may be able to incorporate those effects; however, as we highlight below,
 the timescales and spatial correlations that are seen in such models may
 not necessarily represent faithfully phytoplankton community dynamics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Contrary to other similar models 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
before "e.g.,"
key "birch_master_2006,bouderbala_3d_2018"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, we did not consider explicit effects of local density on survival and
 fertility rates.
 Outside of simply maintaining analytical tractability, we had another,
 more biological reason to do so: we cannot be sure that these local density-dep
endencies make sense in our phytoplankton context.
 To understand why, consider that even if a species abundance is locally
 tripled, competition might not directly ensue at the time scales covered
 by our model, if nutrient depletion has not had time to set in yet.
 We would need lagged local density-dependencies, which are to our knowledge
 not leading to tractable spatial branching or dynamic point processes.
 We could, of course, directly model nutrients, perhaps as resource 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

points
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 with a dynamics of their own 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "murrell_local_2005,north_interactions_2007"

\end_inset

, which in turn change the reproduction or death rate of individuals.
 If the resource points risk being depleted, this entails a negative spatial
 correlation between organisms and their resources 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "murrell_local_2005"

\end_inset

.
 And that is where such models might be inadequate.
 The phycosphere, a micro-environment at the periphery of a phytoplankton
 organism where communities of bacteria interact 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "seymour_zooming_2017"

\end_inset

, can also impact phytoplankton fitness, both positively (cross-feeding)
 and negatively (algicidal activities of bacteria).
 This can sometimes lead to an accumulation of key resources close to the
 phytoplankter.
 This will lead to positive spatial correlations between consumers and their
 resources, and we currently do not have theoretical models to represent
 this (short of modelling precisely these bacteria).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our model should be viewed as a first model of spatial distributions of
 multiple phytoplankton species in a realistic, three-dimensional environment
 at the microscale, describing only basic hydrodynamic and demographic processes.
 Using this model, we were able to guesstimate the differences in potential
 intra vs interspecific interactions between species, emerging at the population
 level through spatial distributions 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 It is worthwhile to keep in mind that there are numerous remaining features
 of phytoplankton physiology and life histories which we do not cover here,
 but may affect their spatial distributions.
 Many phytoplankters are able to move actively in three dimensions, which
 can favour cluster formation 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Finally, a part of spatial structure is explained by the partially colonial
 nature of microphytoplankton

 This clearly calls for viewing our model as a null model to which more
 complex mechanistic models and their spatial outputs can be compared.

\end_inset

We first compute the primitive 
\begin_inset Formula $A=\int\frac{1}{2Dr^{2}+\gamma r^{4}}dr$

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
A & =\int\frac{1}{r^{2}\left(2D+\gamma r^{2}\right)}dr\\

\end_inset

With a change of variable 
\begin_inset Formula $u=\sqrt{\frac{\gamma}{2D}}r$

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $K$

 We can know compute

Time-dependent solution

\begin_layout Standard
In the absence of advection by turbulent diffusion (
\begin_inset Formula $U=0,\,\gamma=0$

), convergence to the steady-state solution can be very slow (more than
 a week, see Section S3 in the SI).
 In order to keep a realistic timeframe, we need to compute a time-dependent
 solution.
 We can get back to Eq.

\end{equation}

\end_inset

Assuming an isotropic environment, this means 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial G}{\partial t}-2D\Delta G=2\lambda C\delta(\boldsymbol{r})
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta=\nabla^{2}$
\end_inset

 is the Laplacian operator.
 We therefore have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}G(\boldsymbol{r},t)=2\lambda C\delta(\boldsymbol{r})
\end{equation}

 can then be computed as

Time-dependent solution

\begin_layout Standard
In the absence of advection (
\begin_inset Formula $U=0,\gamma=0$
\end_inset

), we need to compute a time-dependent solution.
 From eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "eq:pcf_noadv_bbm"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{ccc}
K(\rho) & = & \frac{\lambda}{DC}\int_{0}^{\rho}r\left\{ 1-\erf\left(\frac{r}{\sqrt{8Dt}}\right)\right\} +4\pi r^{2}dr\\
 & = & \frac{\lambda}{CD}\left(\frac{\rho^{2}}{2}-\int_{0}^{\rho}r\times\erf\left(\frac{r}{\sqrt{8Dt}}\right)dr\right)+\frac{4}{3}\pi\rho^{3}.
\end{array}\label{eq:start_K_intra_no_adv}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

We first compute the primitive for 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{0}^{\rho}r\times\erf\left(\frac{r}{\sqrt{8Dt}}\right)dr$
\end_inset

.
 We define 
\begin_inset Formula $u=\frac{r}{\sqrt{8Dt}}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $dr=\sqrt{8Dt}du$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{ccc}
\int_{0}^{\rho}r\times\erf\left(\frac{r}{\sqrt{8Dt}}\right)dr & = & 8Dt\int_{0}^{\rho/\sqrt{8Dt}}u\times\erf\left(u\right)du.\end{array}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

We can integrate by parts, with 
\begin_inset Formula $f=\erf(u)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $g'=u$
\end_inset

, and obtain 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{ccc}
8Dt\int_{0}^{\rho/\sqrt{8Dt}}u\times\erf\left(u\right)du & = & 8Dt\left(\frac{\rho^{2}}{2}\frac{1}{8Dt}\erf(\frac{\rho}{\sqrt{8Dt}})-\frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi}}\int_{0}^{\rho/\sqrt{8Dt}}u^{2}e^{-u^{2}}du\right).\end{array}\label{eq:parts}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

We integrate by parts again, this time with 
\begin_inset Formula $f=u$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $g'=ue^{-u^{2}}$
\end_inset

, which leads to 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\int u^{2}e^{-u^{2}}du=-\frac{ue^{-u^{2}}}{2}+\frac{1}{2}\int e^{-u^{2}}du=-\frac{ue^{-u^{2}}}{2}+\frac{\sqrt{\pi}\erf(u)}{4}.\label{eq:integrate_parts}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

If we use Eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 in Eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:parts"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{ccc}
8Dt\int_{0}^{\rho/\sqrt{8Dt}}u\times\erf\left(u\right)du & = & 8Dt\left(\frac{\rho^{2}}{2}\frac{1}{8Dt}\erf(\frac{\rho}{\sqrt{8Dt}})-\frac{\erf(\frac{\rho}{\sqrt{8Dt}})}{4}+\frac{1}{2\sqrt{\pi}}\frac{\rho}{\sqrt{8Dt}}e^{-\rho^{2}/8Dt}\right)\\
\Leftrightarrow\int_{0}^{\rho}r\times\erf\left(\frac{r}{\sqrt{8Dt}}\right)dr & = & \frac{1}{2}\erf(\frac{\rho}{\sqrt{8Dt}})(\rho^{2}-4Dt)+\frac{\sqrt{2Dt}}{\sqrt{\pi}}\rho e^{-\rho^{2}/8Dt}.
\end{array}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

We can now compute 
\begin_inset Formula $K(\rho)$
\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{ccc}
K(\rho) & = & \frac{\lambda}{CD}\left(\frac{\rho^{2}}{2}-\frac{1}{2}\erf(\frac{\rho}{\sqrt{8Dt}})(\rho^{2}-4Dt)-\frac{\sqrt{2Dt}\rho}{\sqrt{\pi}}e^{-\rho^{2}/8Dt}\right)+\frac{4}{3}\pi\rho^{3}.\end{array}\label{eq:end_K}
